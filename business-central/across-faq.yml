      - question: |
          Is Business Central available in my country/region?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in a limited number of markets, but new countries/regions are added through Microsoft-led localization or through partner-led localization on a quarterly basis. Learn more at [Country/Regional Availability and Supported Translations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json) (available in English only).  
          
      - question: |
          How do I get Business Central?
        answer: |
          You can sign up for a free trial to explore [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[free_trial_md](includes/free_trial_md.md)] If you want more time to explore, [you can extend your trial period](#can-i-extend-my-30-day--new-company--trial-period-).  
          
          To help you get ready for doing business in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can launch assisted setup guides, videos, or help articles for selected setup tasks. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  
          
          When you're ready to buy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page. Learn more at [How do I find a reselling partner?](#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  
          
      - question: |
          Where do I go if I have questions?
        answer: |
          If you have questions about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you can't find an answer for in this documentation, you can ask the Business Central community. Learn more at [Dynamics 365 Business Central community forum](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?groupid=e78817ab-a926-4d31-96cc-aef040a4eb04).  
          
          From the community home page, you can also find links to our blogs where you can also find tips and tricks. Learn more at [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central on the Dynamics 365 blog](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics-365/blog/product/dynamics-365-business-central/) and the older [Dynamics 365 Business Central Blog](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/?blogid=57bdb1f3-851d-4406-a81a-508fef896fc2&groupid=e78817ab-a926-4d31-96cc-aef040a4eb04).  
          
          Finally, you can contact your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner. Learn more at the [How do I get technical support?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-get-technical-support-for-business-central) and [How do I find a reselling partner?](#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner) sections.  
          
      - question: |
          Why can't I find that capability in my Business Central?
        answer: |
          Did you read about a new capability in the release plan or on our blog recently? In that case, your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not have been upgraded to the latest version yet. You can check which version your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on in the [Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md) page.  
          
          This applies to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises.  
          
          Also, if the capability is published as an extension in AppSource, then there's a delay between the extension being announced and its availability in AppSource. This applies to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only.  
          
      - question: |
          Are there any differences between an on-premises deployment and Business Central online?
        answer: |
          Yes. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is optimized for online deployment, and some capabilities might run on premises only under certain circumstances, while others aren't supported at all. Learn more at [Features not implemented in on-premises deployments of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/features-not-implemented-on-premises) (available in English only).
          
      - question: |
          Can I get training in Business Central?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can! You can find free eLearning content on the [Microsoft training site](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs). You can also ask your reselling partner for more training. If you don't know who that is, see the [How do I find a reselling partner?](#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner) section.  
          
          For more information about training across Dynamics 365 that is provided by Microsoft, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 training](/dynamics365/get-started/training/index#dynamics-365-customers) page.  
          
          More content is provided by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] community, such as the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Field Guide](https://leanpub.com/dynamics) that is written by a partner.  
          
      - question: How do I get technical support for Business Central?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is sold through partners, and you should contact your reselling partner to get help with technical problems. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner then can't resolve the problem, they raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  
          
          Learn more at [Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md) and in the [How do I find a reselling partner?](#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner) section.  
          
      - question: |
          Where is the save button?
        answer: |
          There's no *save* button on pages like in other programs that you might be familiar with. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], changes that you make to a field are automatically saved as soon as you move to the next field or close the page, as long as there are no errors. When you make changes to a field and move to another field, you see the text **Saving** in the top-right corner of the page. It changes to **Saved** quickly if no errors occur. If an error occurs, the text changes to **Not Saved**.  
          
      - question: |
          Where do I find that line number?
        answer: |
          Documents such as sales order or purchase invoices consist of headers and lines. Each line has a number that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses to identify this particular line. As a result, you might see a warning or an error message that something is wrong in line number 1000, for example. In the default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], line numbers are hidden. If you want to see the line numbers, you must personalize the current page and add the **Line No.** field. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).  
          
          
      - question: |
          Why does Help describe functionality that I can't access?
        answer: |
          If your Experience setting on the **Company Information** page is set to **Essential**, then UI elements for the Manufacturing and Service Management features aren't visible to you because they require the **Premium** experience. A text note is inserted in high-level help articles for these feature areas. Learn more at [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).  
          
      - question: |
          Why is new information not available in my language?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Learn content about business functionality is published in several languages. The content is authored in English and published to URLs with *en-us* as the language code. When new information is published in English, it's then sent off for translation into the supported languages. This means that you'll not be able to read this new content in your own language for up to four weeks.  
          
          We understand the problems this can cause, and we encourage users to search for what they're looking for in English if they can't find it in their own language.  
          
      - question: What email address can I use with Business Central online?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online doesn't support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  
          
          If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you get a message indicating to use a work or school email address. Learn more at [Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up](ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.md).  
          
          If you want to deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, then you can use other authentication methods. Learn more at [Deployment of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/deployment).  
          
      - question: |
          Do I have to buy Microsoft 365?
        answer: |
          No. But if you want to experience [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as fully integrated with Microsoft 365, you can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Microsoft 365 [here](https://products.office.com/try).  
          
          If you sign up with a non-Microsoft 365 work account (such as joe@mysolution.com), and you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, then you can associate your domain (*mysolution.com*) with the Microsoft 365 subscription. Learn more at [What is a domain?](/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/what-is-a-domain?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) in the Microsoft 365 content.  
          
          If you don't have a Microsoft 365 subscription, and you don't want to buy one, then we provision a new Microsoft Entra tenant for you when you sign up so that you have access to the advanced administration tools in the Azure portal.  
          
      - question: |
          What is the integration with Microsoft 365 about?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is fully integrated with Microsoft 365 so that you can navigate freely between Microsoft 365 apps and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using the app launcher. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can open data in Excel, print reports using Word, and you can work with your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Outlook, for example. Learn more at [Use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as your Business Inbox in Outlook](admin-outlook.md).  
          
      - question: |
          Can I extend my 30-day "New Company" trial period?
        answer: |
          Yes. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching, we display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the **Extend Trial Period** guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose **Extend Trial** in the guide. You can extend the trial period one time yourself. After that, a Microsoft partner can extend it for another 30 days. Learn more at [Extend Your Trial Version](admin-extend-trial.md).
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > It might take up to two business days to complete the trial extension process.

      - question: |
          What are the service level agreements for the cloud?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE [service-terms](includes/service-terms.md)]
          
      - question: |
          How often does Business Central online get updated?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is a service that consists of a Microsoft-maintained platform and business functionality. Many Microsoft partners provide extra business functionality, such as to address specific industry or localization needs. Both business functionality and service components are monitored continuously and updated as appropriate. You can always refer to the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plans/) for an overview of new and upcoming functionality. Learn more at [Service Overview for Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/service-overview) (in English only) and [New and Planned](product-news.md).

      - question: |
          Our administrator has moved me to another plan to give me another role, but I still see the same Home screen in Business Central?
        answer: |
          It's a bit complicated, but it looks like your administrator didn't change your assigned role and assign user groups that match the new license. Essentially, your access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is determined by the type of plan (license) that you have - this sets permissions, your assigned role and your default Home screen. You can change your current role manually in My Settings. But if you're moved to another plan, such as moving you from the Business plan to the Team Members plan, you might see the old Home screen because your permissions weren't changed.  
          
      - question: |
          Can I cancel my subscription?
        answer: |
          Yes, but depending on how you signed up to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], your data can be deleted or preserved. Learn more at [Canceling [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](admin-cancel.md).  
          
      - question: |
          Can I use multi-factor authentication?
        answer: |
          Sure. If you do, you might need an app password in order to send email messages. App passwords give an app or a device access to your email account. The steps for getting an app password vary, depending on your email provider. Learn more at the help from your provider. For example, if you're using Outlook, see [Multi-factor authentication for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365).  
          
      - question: How do I find a reselling partner?
        answer: |
          [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is sold and implemented through a global network of Dynamics 365 partners with industry expertise. Contact a partner for a detailed assessment, consulting services, and other services.

          If you want guidance from Microsoft, contact the [Microsoft Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).  
          
          Your reselling partner will also handle technical support for you. Learn more at [Resources for Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md).  
          
      - question: |
          Is the Windows client supported?
        answer: |
          The first releases of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises included an installable client derived from Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Starting with 2019 release wave 2, this legacy component, referred to as "the Windows client," is no longer available for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [FAQ About the Windows Client and Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/faq-win-cli).
