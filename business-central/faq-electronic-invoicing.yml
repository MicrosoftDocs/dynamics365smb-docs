title: Electronic Invoicing FAQ
summary: |
  The built-in document exchange service submits electronic invoices to TradeShift, a  service provider that relays electronic invoices to PEPPOL or NemHandel recipients. But the service supports a limited number of versions.   
  
  This FAQ answers some of the key questions about electronic invoicing.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > This FAQ page isn't related to the new E-documents app that is available in 2023 release wave 2. To learn more about the new feature, see [E-Documents overview](finance-edocuments-overview.md).  

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: What is the problem?
        answer: The built-in support of PEPPOL uses an API provided by TradeShift. But that API does not support newer versions of PEPPOL.
      - question: Which is last version of PEPPOL supported by the TradeShift API?
        answer: The last version of PEPPOL supported by the TradeShift API is **PEPPOL BIS 2.1**.
      - question: Which is last version of PEPPOL supported by Business Central?
        answer: The last version of PEPPOL supported by the default version of Business Central is **PEPPOL BIS 3.0**. We will keep the existing document exchange service based on TradeShift running as long as TradeShift supports the current API. Additionally, we continue to support the currently supported electronic invoicing formats.
