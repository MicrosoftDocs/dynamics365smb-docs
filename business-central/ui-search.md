# Finding Pages and Information with Tell Me

This article describes how the in-product search box, *Tell Me*, can help you quickly go to things like actions, pages, or reports, find information about how to complete a particular task, and discover other apps and consulting services for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  


> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086048]

When you need help with finding something, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Tell me what you want to do** icon to search for it. You can also use <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to start using Tell Me.

When you start typing characters, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately displays matches. Results in the list change as you type more characters. If you notice that when you enter the word "product" and the results include **Items** that's because Tell Me uses synonyms and alternate search terms to make it easier to find actions, pages, and reports.

The column to the right indicates the general category of the result. For example, whether it will open a list page or is an administrative task.  

At the bottom of the **Tell Me** page, the action **exploring pages and reports** opens a feature overview that shows you all available features for your role or for all roles. Learn more at [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you prefer to use your keyboard, use the Tab key and Arrow keys to choose an item in the results. If you select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard without choosing a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens the result that is listed first.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Find an action on the current page

The **On Current Page** section lets you find and do work on the page you have open. For example, if the **Sales Quote** page is open and you type "customer," the section includes an action that opens the customer card for the customer chosen on the sales quote.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list includes only actions that are available on the navigation bar at the top of the page. Actions on FastTabs are not included.  

## Find a page or a task

The results in the **Go to Pages and Tasks** section provide access to other pages and let you perform tasks or look up information. If you use these pages often, you can choose the bookmark icon to add a link to any page onto your Role Center. For more information, see [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

The pages and tasks that are listed depend on the user experience you chose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the **Essential** experience. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

## Find a report or archived information

The **Go to Reports and Analysis** section offers access to reporting tools. For example, you can open the **Balance Sheet** report from the list, or access archived documents and other information.  

## Find information in the Help

Under **Documentation**, you'll see a link to repeat your search in Microsoft's documentation. If you choose the link, then the Help pane opens and shows search results.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Documentation for third-party extensions is not included in the results.

## Get more functionality from apps

Our partner community is busily developing apps that add capabilities to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Get from Microsoft AppSource** section lists apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that are available on Microsoft AppSource and are related to the keyword you searched for.

## Search for data

The **Tell me what you want to do** function doesn't search for data, such as customer names, addresses, or transactions. Instead, you can search for data in list pages by choosing the ![Search list](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** icon in the left corner of the list header. The search applies only to the list you're viewing. For more information, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Starting in 2022 release wave 2, you can search for posted document lines, such as invoice lines, credit memo lines, shipment lines, and receipt lines. Search for the type of document lines that you want to find, and then bookmark the links to the documents on your home page for easy access to the original or a filtered view. Learn more at [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

## Questions?

We have shown Tell Me to a range of stakeholders, noted the questions that they had in common, and turned our notes into a list frequently asked questions. If you're interested, see [Tell Me FAQ](ui-search-faq.md).
