# Local Functionality in [!INCLUDE[prodlong](includes/prodlong.md)]

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] has a combined localization strategy inclusive of both Microsoft-led and partner-led models. In this section, you can see descriptions of functionality that applies to the countries where Microsoft provides the regulatory compliance and other local functionality.  

For a list of currently supported markets, see [Country/Regional Availability and Supported Translations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).
