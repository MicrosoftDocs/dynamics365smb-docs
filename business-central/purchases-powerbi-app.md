[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides executives, purchasing managers, and procurement teams with valuable insights into purchasing activities. This app can help you streamline purchasing processes, improve decision-making at all levels of the organization, and optimize spending by offering detailed analytics and visualizations of purchasing data. Use its reports to increase transparency, efficiency, and cost savings in your daily operations.

## Purchases analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Procurement Officer

### Example scenario: preparing purchasing budgets

As the CEO of a manufacturing company, you need to stay on top of rising raw material costs to maintain profitability. For the leadership team, it's important to understand your organization's spending. The [Purchases Overview](purchases-powerbi-purchases-overview.md) and [Moving Annual Total](purchases-powerbi-moving-annual-total.md) reports can give you a better understanding of how much money you spend on purchasing activities and quickly spot increases in raw material costs.

You can also use the [Actual and Budget](purchases-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md) report to monitor the actual spending against the allocated budget. This comparison helps you make informed decisions to plan ahead for the coming months and years, giving you better budget control.

## Purchases analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: reducing raw material costs

Purchase Managers in manufacturing ensure they have the materials they need to meet production demands. You notice an increase in the cost of a material, which could affect profitability. Using the [Purchases Decomposition](purchases-powerbi-purchases-decomposition.md) and [Purchases by Item](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-item.md) reports, you can quickly identify the vendor that provides the material and analyze the purchase amount compared to the previous year. This information can help you negotiate better prices with the vendor.

To monitor purchasing activities and ensure compliance with weekly or monthly budgets, the [Daily Purchases](purchases-powerbi-daily-purchases.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of purchase amounts. It aggregates amounts by day, week, month, and year. Use this report to spot unexpected spikes in spending and take corrective action before it affects your budget.

Also, you can use the [Moving Averages](purchases-powerbi-moving-averages.md) report to analyze purchasing trends and identify opportunities to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The **Purchases by Location** report can help you find discrepancies in purchasing patterns across different locations and make decisions.

## Purchases analytics for daily purchasing work

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Agent
- Purchasing Officer

### Example scenario: selecting vendors for purchasing raw materials

As a purchaser for a manufacturing company, you source materials for production. Part of your role is to keep purchasing costs under control to maintain profitability in the allocated budget. Use the **Purchases by Item** report to see the breakdown of purchases by item and category.

You notice that the company spent significantly on a particular category of materials. The purchase amount increased compared to the previous year. You decide to investigate by looking at the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report, which shows the breakdown of purchases by vendor.

You identify that one vendor consistently provided the materials at a higher price than other vendors. To analyze spending and manage your supplier relationship, use the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report. The report shows the purchasing activities for each vendor, including the amount spent, the number of transactions, and the vendors that supplied a specific category of material.
