# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

Business Central offers a free trial. After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try things out with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## To sign up for the trial

1. Go to [the trial site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847861), choose *Finance and operations*, and then, on the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** card, choose the **Try for free** button.  
2. Enter your work or school email address and other details. You'll be redirected to your trial at [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/).  

The trial takes a few moments to load, then you can start using the app.
