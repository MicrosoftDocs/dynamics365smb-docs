# Set Up Payment Days and Non-Payment Periods
Payment days and non-payment periods are used to calculate due dates. Due date calculation is used for sales and purchase documents.  

A payment day is a day on which invoices are paid.  

A non-payment period is a range of dates during which the company does not make payments. This functionality is often used for holiday periods.  

For sales and purchase invoices, the customer and vendor payment days and non-payment periods are taken into account.
