# How to: Generate Delivery Reminders
In ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/how-to-create-delivery-reminders-manually.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To create delivery reminders, you must set up the delivery reminder properties. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Delivery Reminders](how-to-set-up-delivery-reminders.md).  
  
### To generate delivery reminders for all overdue deliveries  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, choose **New**.  
  
3.  In the **Delivery Reminder** window, on the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Create Delivery Reminder**.  
  
4.  On the **Purchase Header** FastTab and the **Purchase Line** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
  
5.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
 If there are overdue deliveries that match the filters that you have set, deliver reminders are created. You can now issue and print the delivery reminders.
