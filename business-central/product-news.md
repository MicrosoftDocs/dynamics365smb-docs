# What's New in Dynamics 365 Business Central

[!include [release notes](includes/release-notes.md)]

You can always refer to the release plan for an overview of new and upcoming functionality. Here in the documentation, you can then find topics that can help you learn about new and existing features in [!INCLUDE[prodlong](includes/prodlong.md)].  

If you haven't already, then sign up for a [trial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847861), get introduced to the basics of what you can do with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], and then try things out on your own for a while. When you are ready, you can open a blank company and set things up for yourself. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

On a regular basis, we will update [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with additional capabilities in the core application and with new extensions. For the current list of Microsoft extensions, see [Customizing Business Central Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

To see all extensions offered by [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] partners, see [AppSource, Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

## Check the Dynamics 365 Blog

We talk about new capabilities on [the Dynamics 365 Blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/), including when they are made available, and if there are special considerations.  

For the partner community, we publish information on [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central on the Dynamics 365 Blog for partners](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/product/business-central/) and in the [Developer and IT-pro Help for [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] ](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/index).
