# Change company and other settings in Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams includes a **Settings** page that lets you view and change information about your connection to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you switch the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and company you're connected to. You can also see which account you're using to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and sign out and in again as needed.

There are two ways to open the **Settings** page: 1) from the message compose box or 2) from the command box.

1. Next to the message compose box, select **+**, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app icon, then select **Settings**.

2. From the command box at the top, search for **/Business Central** and then select the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app icon. Then, in the message that appears the under the **[search for business contacts]** box, select **... (More options)** and then **Settings**. If the message isn't displayed, click the **[search for business contacts]** box.
