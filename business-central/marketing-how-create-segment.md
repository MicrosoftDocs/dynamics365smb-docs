# Create Segments
You can create segments to select a group of contacts, for example, if you want to create an interaction involving several contacts, such as direct mail.

## To create a segment
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **General** section, in the **No.** field, enter a number for the segment.

    Alternatively, if you have set up number series for segments in the **Marketing Setup** window, you can press Enter to select the next available segment number.
4. Fill in the other fields on the header.

You can now add contacts to the segment. For more information, see [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).
