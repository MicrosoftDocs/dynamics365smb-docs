# Your Access to the Intelligent Cloud with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]

As a user of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] online, you have full access to scenarios that are based on the intelligent cloud, such as editing data in Excel and pushing changes back to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], or when you view your data in Power BI. However, while [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] is a cloud-first service, also those customers who need to run their workloads fully on-premises or on the intelligent edge connected to the cloud can do so.  

If you are interested in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], you can sign up for a free trial of the default, cloud deployment solution, or you can choose to work with a partner to deploy [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] locally to your own choice of hardware. You can then decide to connect to the cloud through your tenant in the cloud. As a result, the data from your locally deployed [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] will be replicated to the cloud for intelligent cloud scenarios.  

Connecting to the intelligent cloud from an on-premises solution requires your administrator to specify information about your database. For more information, see [Connect to the Intelligent Cloud](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/about-intelligent-edge) in the ITPro content for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)].  

## Viewing Intelligent Cloud Insights in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] Online

In your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] online company, the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page shows four key points of interest for most businesses:

- Cash availability
- Sales profitability
- Net income
- Inventory value

Next to the KPI charts, you get insights into potential areas of concern, including overdue payments. Choose each insight to drill into the data.

The page also connects to Power BI for even more insights.

## Viewing Intelligent Cloud Insights On-Premises

When your Dynamics 365 reselling partner has acquired the right license for your on-premises solution to connect to the cloud through [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], your administrator can set up the connection. Once that is done, you can view the same insights from the cloud in your on-premises application. Depending on the on-premises solution, the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page can be embedded in the Home page or be a separate page as in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] online and on-premises.
