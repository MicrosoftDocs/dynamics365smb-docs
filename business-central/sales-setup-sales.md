# Setting Up Sales
Before you can manage sales processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's sales policies.

You must define the general setup, such as which sales documents are required and how their values are posted. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation.

A separate series of tasks related to registering new customers is to record any special price or discount agreements that you have with each customer.

Finance-related sales setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the Finance Setup section. For more information, see [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md).
