# The WorldPay Payments Standard extension

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is marked as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.

The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.

If you enable the extension, when you send a sales invoice by email the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).
