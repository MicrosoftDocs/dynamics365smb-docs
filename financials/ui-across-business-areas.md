# General Business Functionality
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance and sales. For more information, see [Business Functionality](madeira-business-functionality.md).

To support those business area-specific tasks, you can use a variety of general business functionality, such as defining extended text for document lines and organizing connecting business tasks in workflows.

The following table lists these general business areas with links to topics that describe them.
