## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to help them track revenue and cost breakdown per location. The report is valuable for any organization that operates across multiple locations.

For COOs of retail companies with multiple warehouse locations, it's important to have a high-level view of the sales performance of each location. The overview can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans. You can quickly view the total revenue generated by each location and identify under-performing locations. This information helps you make better decisions about resource allocation to ensure that the organization is operating efficiently and effectively across all locations.

Regional managers who oversee several warehouse locations can track revenue and cost breakdown per location, identify areas for improvement, and adjust sales strategies. Analyze the total sales amount, quantity sold, cost of goods sold, and gross profit for each location to find out which locations perform well and which ones need improvement.
