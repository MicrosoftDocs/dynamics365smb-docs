# Create manual remittance payments in the Norwegian version

Generally, payments are created automatically in the payment journal using the remittance suggestion function. However, you can also create a payment manually, either as a payment of an existing invoice or as a payment without a link to an existing invoice, such as a payment to a vendor.  

## To create a manual remittance payment  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Info**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Info** page, choose the **Initialize Payment Info** action.  

    If the payment is linked to an existing vendor ledger entry, information is transferred from the entry. If the payment isn't linked to a vendor ledger entry, only partial information is created.  

3. Choose the **OK** button.
