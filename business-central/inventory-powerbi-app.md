[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](../includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Inventory Power BI is designed to pull data directly from Business Central and provided leadership, managers and different key warehouse staff key information on inventory across an organization. This app has a variety of different reports which provide insights into different parts of a business's operations. With the information from this report, you can make more informed decisions ensuring you meet demand, not delay production and ensuring costs are low.

## Inventory Analytics for the Leadership team
To fit this category you might have a role such as:
- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example Scenario: Maintaining Stock Turnover
As a COO, you want to ensure that stock is moving and you don't have any aging stock on hand. By analzying the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) report, you can see how much stock is in each lot and identify where there is expired stock. You can also compare this with the information on the [Purchase and Sales Quantity](inventory-powerbi-purchase-and-sales-qty.md) to ensure you aren't over purchasing and increasing storage costs. 

## Inventory Analytics for the management team
To fit this category you might have a role such as:
- Warehouse Manager
- Procurement Manager
- Supply Chain Manager
- Production Manager

### Example Scenario: Maintaining Stock on Hand
As a warehouse manager, you want to ensure each of the locations under your control have adequate stock levels. Using the [Inventory by Location](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-location.md) you can ensure each location has adequate stock and move stock around to ensure each location is adequately supplied.

As a Production or Procurement manager, you can use the [Gross Requirement](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) to ensure that your production planning is met by the stock you are getting it. 

## Inventory Analytics for the warehouse team
To fit this category you might have a role such as:
- Order Picker
- Shipping 

### Example Scenario: Tracking Stock
As an order picker in a warehouse, you want to ensure each bin you go to contains enough stock to meet your order. Using the [Bin Contents](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents.md) report you can be sure that the bin contains the right amount of stock. You can drill into this further by using the [Bin Contents by Item Tracking](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents-by-item-tracking.md) to see the tracking information.

Furthermore, other staff in the warehouse can use either the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) or [Inventory by Serial](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-serial-no.md) to see lot and serial information on an item by item basis.
