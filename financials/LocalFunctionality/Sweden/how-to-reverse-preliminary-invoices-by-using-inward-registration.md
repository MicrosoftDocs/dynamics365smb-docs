### To reverse a preliminary invoice  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select an invoice that has been posted using inward registration.  
  
3.  On the **Navigate** tab, in the **Invoice** group, choose **Inward Registration**.  
  
4.  On the **Actions** tab, choose **Edit** to open the **Inward Registration** window.  
  
5.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, and then choose **Reverse**.  
  
6.  Choose **Yes** to confirm that you want to reverse the inward registration.
