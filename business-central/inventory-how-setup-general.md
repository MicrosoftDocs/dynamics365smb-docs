# Set Up General Inventory Information
You specify your general inventory setup in the **Inventory Setup** window.

## To set up general inventory information
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Inventory Setup** window, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

If you want to include warehouse handling time in the order promising calculation on the purchase line, you can set it up as a default for the inventory, in the **Inventory Setup** window, and for your location. For more information, see [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).
