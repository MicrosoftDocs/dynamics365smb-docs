# Manage Human Resources
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can keep detailed records of your employees. You can register and maintain employee information, such as employment contracts, confidential information, qualifications, and employee contacts.

> [!NOTE]  
>   This functionality requires that your experience is set to **Suite**. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

To start using the Human Resources functionality, you must set up employees and other basic information. You can then associate various codes to an employee, which allows you to filter information for specific employees.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
