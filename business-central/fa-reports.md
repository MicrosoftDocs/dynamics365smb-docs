# Fixed assets reports in Business Central

When you prepare a balance sheet and income statement, you might have to generate reports to analyze the depreciation, acquisition, disposal, and gain or loss values for an accounting period. You might also need reports that show:

* Accumulated depreciation and book value at the end of a period.
* List your fixed assets for inventory, insurance, and other management purposes.

This article describes the built-in reports for fixed assets.
