# Changing from a QuickBooks app to Dynamics 365 Business Central

More growing businesses are changing from finance apps like QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online, which are designed for startups and other small businesses, to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which also supports larger, more complex organizations.

To help transfer data, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers built-in extensions that migrate data such as customers, vendors, inventory items, and general ledger accounts. The following extensions are installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide:
