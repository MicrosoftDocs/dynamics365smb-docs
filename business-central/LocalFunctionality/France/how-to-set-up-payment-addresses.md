# Set Up Payment Addresses in the French Version

To use payment management, you must set up payment addresses that will be used for vendors and customers at the time of settlement. The payment address can differ from the default address.  

The following procedure describes how to set up a payment address for a vendor, but the same steps apply to setting up a payment address for a customer.  

## To set up a payment address  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2. Select a vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Choose the **Payment Addresses** action.  
4. Fill in the required fields as described in the following table.

    |**Name**|The name associated with the payment address.|  
    |**Address**|The payment address.|  

5. Choose the **OK** button.
