# Posting depreciation differences in the Finnish version

In Finland, the following depreciation methods are commonly used for fixed assets:  

- Straight-line depreciation which posts fixed assets to the general ledger.  
- Declining balance depreciation which doesn't post fixed assets to the general ledger.  

Finnish tax law requires the difference in accumulated depreciation between two methods to be calculated and posted in the general ledger.
