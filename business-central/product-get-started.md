# Getting Started with [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. Signing up is easy, and you can migrate existing business data from your legacy system.  

To help you with your subscription, find a [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.md#findpartner).  

When you sign up for [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], you get access to a demonstration company. The demonstration company contains sample data, but you can create new sales documents, for example, or set up a bank account. However, if you want to use [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] to help run your business, you must contact a [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] reselling partner and buy a subscription. For more information about trials and subscriptions, see [Trials and Subscriptions](across-preview.md).  

## Get to know [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], some things will be familiar to you, and other things might be unfamiliar. For some quick, nice-to-know tricks, see:  

* [Find things](ui-search.md)  
* [Searching, Filtering, and Sorting Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md)  
* [Entering Data](ui-enter-data.md)  

For more information, see [Working with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](ui-work-product.md).  

> [!TIP]  
> You can always get back to the Role Center by selecting the company name in the upper left corner.

In the demonstration company, the Business Manager and Accountant Role Centers include the Getting Started tile and the Product Videos tile. Both tiles launch pages where you can choose between different videos that can help you get started with different aspects of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. You can find more videos on our YouTube channel. For more information, see [Visit Our Video Library](across-videos.md). You can also find eLearning content for the base version of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] on [Microsoft Learn](/learn/browse/?products=dynamics-business-central). If you want more assistance, contact a [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] partner.  

When you are ready to start working and you want to look at some of the business processes that [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports, see [Business Functionality](across-business-functionality.md).

Before you can begin to use functionality, certain setup must be made. To get started, simply choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then the **Assisted Setup** action. For more information, see also [Setting Up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](setup.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Some setup steps can be performed semi-automatically by using assisted setup guides. Others required manual setup, and you can find a list in the **Advanced Settings** page.

<!--Some Role Center pages provide a **Setup and Extensions** button. Here you have access to a list of assisted setup guides that can help you get started by setting selected areas up quickly. If an area is not covered by an assisted setup, choose the **Manual Setup** action to access setup pages where you can fill in setup fields for all areas manually. For more information, see also [Setting Up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](setup.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> The list of setup guides, extensions, and services that are available differ depending on the user experience you choose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the Essential experience. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).  -->

For an overview of current capabilities and what is coming, take a look at our release plan at [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Release Plan](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2047422).  

## The Role Centers
The Role Center page is based on a role-centric design to give you fast access to the business process and intelligence tools that you need to do your job. For example, an accountant can monitor payments and approvals, and view finance performance charts. Find out what your current role gives access to with the role explorer. For more information, see [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md). Check out the various Role Centers by choosing the **Settings** icon ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") in the top right corner, choosing **My Settings**, and then the Role Center to explore. You are automatically signed out and in again to apply the change. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

## Trying things out in your own company
Thinking about subscribing? You can easily change from the demonstration company, and create and work in a company of your own. This is a great way to start toward a subscription. Setups for finances are provided; you just need to create or import your customers, vendors, and the products or services that you sell. After that, you're ready to post invoices and use business intelligence tools to analyze your business. You can use your company for free for a 30-day trial period. If you subscribe to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] during that time, you're already up and running. You can continue with the work you did during the trial.  

To create a company to try things out, go to the **My Settings** menu in the top right corner, and change the company to **My Company**. Sign out of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and then sign in again to apply the change. An assisted setup guide will help you provide basic information about your company. When that's done, explore the Role Center and find the **Assisted Setup** action.  

You can also contact a Dynamics 365 reselling partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.md#findpartner).  

## Getting answers to questions

If you are not sure how to do something in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can hopefully find the answer either from reading the tooltip for the field that you are unsure of, or by reading the content by opening the *Learn more* link in a tooltip (use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F1 ). You can also get to the documentation by choosing the related link in the [Help and Support page](product-help-and-support.md).  

All fields in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] are described in tooltips. You can access tooltips by choosing the name of the field. For example, in a page like the **Customer Card**, simply choose the name of the field to read the tooltip. In a list such as the **Customers** list, or the lines in a document such as a sales order, you have to choose the drop-down menu to the right of the name of the column and then choose the **What's this?** menu item.  

If you have additional questions, we recommend that you ask the community or contact your reselling partner. For more information, see [Where do I go if I have questions?](across-faq.md#where-do-i-go-if-i-have-questions).  

## Ready to subscribe?

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, you must contact a Dynamics 365 reselling partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.md#findpartner) and [[!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Trials and Subscriptions](across-preview.md).
