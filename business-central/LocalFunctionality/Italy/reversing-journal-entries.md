# Reversing Journal Entries
Controls have been added to the **Reverse Transaction Entries** window to comply with local laws. These controls ensure the following:  

- You cannot reverse an invoice, credit note, or document involving VAT management.  
- You cannot reverse posted invoices, credit memos, or debit memos.  
- You cannot delete posted invoices, credit memos, or general journals in the sales, purchase, or service area—even if they have been printed.  
- You cannot reverse sales, purchase, or service headers for reserved documents.
