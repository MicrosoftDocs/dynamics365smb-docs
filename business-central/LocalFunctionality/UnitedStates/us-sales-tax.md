# Reporting Sales Tax in the US

[!INCLUDE [sales-tax](../includes/CAMXUS/sales-tax-setup.md)]

If you set up new tax areas and tax jurisdictions, you must make sure that you fill in the fields correctly. In the United States, states, counties, cities, and localities can charge sales tax. Companies collect and remit sales tax to these government authorities for products sold to end users. Sales tax can also be charged to existing sales tax. For example, tax can be calculated on a sales invoice amount that already includes the tax from other jurisdictions.  

## Tax Details

The **Tax Details** page shows different combinations of sales tax jurisdictions and sales tax groups to establish sales tax rates. For each tax jurisdiction, we recommend that you set up one tax group for normal sales tax, another tax group for items or services that are not taxed, and an additional tax group for every type of item or service that is handled with a different sales tax rate in that jurisdiction.

In the United States, when you sell to a customer at a location where you do not have a *situs*—or a legal location in that state—you do not collect sales tax. For locations in which you do not have a situs, ensure that both the **Tax Below Minimum** and **Tax Above Maximum** fields are 0.00.
