# Intelligent Cloud Extensions

This extension will connect your data from [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] on-premises with [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] online for intelligent insights.  

If you are using one of the supported on-premises products, you can configure your intelligent cloud environment based on a product-specific extension. Once your intelligent cloud environment is configured, you will be able to replicate data from your on-premises solution to your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] cloud tenant. This will enable you to take full advantage of what the cloud has to offer your business such as, enhanced insights into your business, artificial intelligence, multiple device access, and anytime, anywhere access.  

## Business Central on-premises
If you are using an on-premises deployment of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], get the **Intelligent Cloud Base** extension and the **Business Central Intelligent Cloud** extension, and then run the **Intelligent Cloud Setup** assisted setup guide.  

## Dynamics GP
If you are using Dynamics GP, get the **Intelligent Cloud Base Extension** extension, the **Dynamics GP Data Migration** extension, and the **Dynamics GP Intelligent Cloud** extension, and then run the **Intelligent Cloud Setup** assisted setup guide.  

## Dynamics NAV
If you are using Dynamics NAV, get the **Intelligent Cloud Base Extension** extension and the **Dynamics NAV Intelligent Cloud** extension, and then run the **Intelligent Cloud Setup** assisted setup guide.
