# Fixed Asset Book Value 01 (report)

The *Fixed Asset Book Value 01* report shows detailed information about acquisition cost, depreciation value, and book value for both individual assets and groups of assets. 

The detailed information are also summarized at a group level if needed. 

For each of these three amount types, amounts are calculated at the beginning and at the end of a specified period and for the period itself. If you select the **Budget Report** field, the report will calculate the expected depreciation for the period. Enter a *group type* if you want the report to group the fixed assets and print group totals. For example, if you have set up six FA classes, select the *FA Class* option to have group totals printed for each of the six class codes.

The report shows the output structured over multiple columns and displays one line for each asset.
