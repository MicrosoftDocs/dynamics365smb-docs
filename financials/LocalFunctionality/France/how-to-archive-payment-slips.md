# How to: Archive Payment Slips
When a payment slip has been processed, you can separate it from the active payment slips by archiving it.  
  
 You can archive the payment slip by using the following methods:  
  
-   Manually – for individual payment slips.  
  
-   Automatically – for a batch of payment slips.  
  
### To archive a payment slip  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Payment Slips**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  Select the relevant payment slip, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  
  
3.  In the **Payment Slip** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Archive**.  
  
4.  Choose the **Yes** button to archive the payment slip.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the current status of the payment slip does not allow archiving, a message is displayed.  
  
### To archive a batch of payment slips  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Archive Payment Slips**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  In the **Archive Payment Slips** window, on the **Payment Header** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
     The payment slips are archived.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This batch job will only archive payment slips that have the **Archiving Authorized** check box selected in the **Payment Status** window. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Payment Statuses](how-to-set-up-payment-statuses.md).
