# Submit VAT statements in the Italian version

Companies must pay VAT for most purchased goods and services. VAT can be deducted if the goods and services that are purchased by a company are used in the production of its income.  

You must submit periodic VAT statements to the tax authorities to list transactions that include VAT with amounts over a specific threshold. Before you submit your VAT statement, you should review the VAT statement, and then settle and post the VAT transactions.  

## Review and print VAT statements  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statements**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, in the **Name** field, select the required VAT statement, and then choose the **Print** action.  
1. On the **Options** FastTab, enter a date interval to limit the period covered by the statement and define what type of VAT entries that you want to include.  
1. Choose the **Print** button to print the VAT statement.  

You can use the printed VAT statement to review the VAT entries to be submitted to the tax authorities.  

## Settle and post VAT transactions  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement**, and then choose the related link.

1. Choose the **Print** button to print the VAT settlement and post the entries.  

After you calculate and post the VAT settlement, VAT amounts are transferred to the appropriate VAT settlement accounts.
