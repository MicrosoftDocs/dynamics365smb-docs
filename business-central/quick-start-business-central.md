# Business Central Quick Starts

Quick start articles help you get set up sooner so you can begin performing the basic [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] functions you need.

The following sections offer beginner's guides that help you get familiar with the features you need in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In each quick start, you'll find links to more advanced content about the functionality, should you need it.

## Provide basic information about your company

The first step is to provide the basic information about your company. This includes information such as address, bank accounts, value-added tax (VAT) number, and so on. You'll find it explained in the [Company Information Quick Start](quick-start-company-information.md).

## Prepare basic financial information

Next, it's time to enter your company's financial information so you're ready to do business. Use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s included chart of accounts (COA) to save time. And if you need to, you can customize it in a few steps by following the [Financial Information Quick Start](quick-start-financial-information.md).
