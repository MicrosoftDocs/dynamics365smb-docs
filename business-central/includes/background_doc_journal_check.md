## Check data in documents and journals while you work

Your administrator can enable [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] to validate the data you enter in documents and journals in real time.

If you enable the feature, the FactBox Pane shows either a **Check Document** or **Check Journal** FactBox, depending on the type of document you're working on. The FactBox lists the errors on the page so you can quickly resolve them.

To enable the feature, on the **My Notifications** page, choose the following checkboxes:

* For journals, choose the **Enabled** checkbox for **Enable Data Check**.
* For documents, choose the **Enabled** checkbox for **Show the Document Check FactBox**.

The following video explains real-time data check.
