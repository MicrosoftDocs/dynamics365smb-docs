# Setting Up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes standard configurations for most business processes, but you can change the configuration to suit the needs of company.

For example, your chart of accounts is prefilled with a number of posting accounts ready for use. You can, of course, change the chart of accounts to suit your needs. For more information, see [Finance](finance.md).

From your Role Center, you can access assisted setup guides that help you configure certain scenarios and add features to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For information about how to access all assisted and manual setup windows, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).
