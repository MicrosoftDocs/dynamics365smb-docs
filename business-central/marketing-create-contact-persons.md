# Creating Contact Persons
You create a contact by setting up a contact card for the person. You can create contact persons from existing contact companies, or you can create independent contact persons.

For example, after meeting with a prospective company, you meet the purchaser. You can create a contact card for this person so communication can be more tailored.

You may also need some publications about your products translated and after some research decide on a freelance translator. You should record this contact as an independent contact person.

By recording as many details as possible about a contact person ensures that all groups at your company can find the relevant information.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
