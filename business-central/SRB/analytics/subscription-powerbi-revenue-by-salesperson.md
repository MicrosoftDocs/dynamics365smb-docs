# Revenue by Salesperson (Power BI Report)

The **Revenue by Salesperson** report provides an overview of monthly recurring revenue (MRR) generated by each salesperson. It allows users to evaluate sales performance, recurring profitability, and churn impact at an individual salesperson level.

## Use the report

This report helps management and sales teams understand how monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is distributed across salespeople and how individual portfolios contribute to overall recurring revenue and profitability.

Sales managers can use the report to monitor the recurring revenue performance of each salesperson and identify top performers as well as negative trends. For example, if a salesperson’s MRR shows higher churn than others, managers can drill down to customers and subscription items to identify the cause and take corrective actions, such as coaching, portfolio adjustments, or targeted support.

Salespeople can use the report to track the performance of their own customer portfolios. By analyzing MRR, recurring cost, net recurring profit, and churn by customer and subscription product, they can identify which customers and subscriptions contribute most to their results and where opportunities exist to upsell, cross-sell, or stabilize recurring revenue.
