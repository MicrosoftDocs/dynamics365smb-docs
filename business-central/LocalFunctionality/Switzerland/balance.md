# Balance
Specifies a temporary general ledger balance. When you choose the **Balance** action in the **G/L Accounts** window, the **G/L Acc. Provisional Balance** window opens. It shows the balance of the final posted ledger entries and the balance of the postings entered in the current general journal.
