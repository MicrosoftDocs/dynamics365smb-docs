# Settle Purchase Invoices Promptly
If you need to pay the vendor by cash or check, you can post the payment when you post the invoice.  
  
### To settle purchase invoices promptly  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Home** tab, choose **New**.  
3.  To pay either in cash or by bank transfer, enter the number of the general ledger cash account or the bank account in the **Bal. Account No.** field.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** fields are not included in the standard layout of the invoice header. In order to post the payment of an invoice, you must first insert them with the design facilities.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you frequently pay purchase invoices in cash, it is a good idea to set up a specific payment method with a balancing account and enter this method in the **Payment Method** field on the vendor card. The balancing account number is inserted automatically on the invoice header every time you create a new invoice.
