To submit vendor payments electronically in Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) ISO 20022 payment format, you must set up prerequisites for enabling SEPA payments in your company.  

Your version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses the generic functionality for SEPA payments but is optimized for local requirements. To set up countries/regions, bank accounts, vendors, vendor bank accounts, and the payment journal, see [Setting Up SEPA Credit Transfer](../../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#setting-up-sepa-credit-transfer). [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
