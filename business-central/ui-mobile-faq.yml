      - question: |
          Is it the same experience in the apps as in the browser?
        answer: |
          No, not exactly. For example, we show only the **Home** activity group due to the limited screen size on mobile devices. Similarly, the keyboard shortcuts are not available because you mainly use touch rather than a keyboard to navigate on mobile devices.

      - question: |
          Can I connect the app to our on-premises solution?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can! It's a slightly different way to signing in, that's all. For more information, see [Use Business Central on-premises?](install-mobile-app.md#use-business-central-on-premises).  

      - question: |
          Can a guest user use the app to access our Business Central solution?
        answer: |
          No. Guest users are invited users from a different Microsoft Entra tenant than yours. In this case, the app will authenticate to the guest user's primary Microsoft Entra tenant and try to open the Business Central endpoint on that tenant instead of yours.
