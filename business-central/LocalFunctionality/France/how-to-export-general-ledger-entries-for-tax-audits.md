# Export General Ledger Entries for Tax Audits
The standard audit file for tax purposes records key business information (transactions and ledger postings) into a file in a specified common format for audit purposes. In France, you are required to provide the government with this information in a standard audit file beginning in January 2014. This applies to companies for both corporate tax and VAT audit purposes.  

In general, the report is designed to provide information on account types that include posted entries.  

You can choose to include opening balances in the file, but these are not actual entries that are posted in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] calculates the opening balance by using the entries for a given account up to the starting date that you have specified for the file. The closing entries generated by the closing prior year end process are also included in the calculation. The opening balances are then mapped into the required fields of the report.  

If you do not close your fiscal year or do not run the **Close Year** action before generating the report, income statement accounts will still have balances, which will be reported in the file.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Opening balances are only included in the report for accounts that have a balance not equal to zero. You can identify opening balances by the following values in the fields:  
>   
>  -   JournalCode = 0  
> -   JournalLib = BALANCE OUVERTURE  
> -   EcritureNum = 0  
> -   EcritureLib = Accounts prefixed with BAL OUV  
> -   ValidDate = Start date specified on the report's request page  

## To export general ledger entries to a text file for a tax audit  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Export G/L Entries – Tax Audit**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  In the **Export G/L Entries – Tax Audit** window, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|Enter the date to use as the starting date for the time period to be covered by the audit.|  
    |**Ending Date**|Enter the date to use as the ending date for the time period to be covered by the audit.|  
    |**Include Opening Balances**|Select if you want to include opening balances in the audit report file. The balances are calculated as of the date before the first date of the period covered by the report.|  

3.  Choose the **OK** button to export the file.  

When you create the report, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] sorts the information in the report by the **No.** and **Creation Date** fields in the general ledger register.  

The report will have the following name: <taxpayername>FEC<YYYYMMDD>
