# SEPA payments in the Belgian version

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions. This makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. Regardless of location, European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations.
