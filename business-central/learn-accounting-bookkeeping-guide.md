# Accounting and bookkeeping

Accounting is a critical function in any enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, and also in most businesses. Accounting represents the process of recording and cataloging a company's financial transactions, and then retrieving, measuring, summarizing, and presenting the results by using different reports that are often required by local legislation. The primary goal of this process is to help the company's management understand the financials of the business and measure the results of the company's economic activities.

Bookkeeping is one part of the accounting process and involves regularly recording all financial transactions in a company.
