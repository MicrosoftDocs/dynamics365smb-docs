# G/L account group – Multi-circuit accounting in the Czech version

According to accounting standards, an accounting entity can post transactions within multiple internal accounting areas (Financial, Off-Balance, and Intercompany Accounting).
To set up accounting areas in the system, the G/L Account Group field on the CoA account card is used. The system stops posting to financial accounts with different accounting areas in a single accounting transaction.
