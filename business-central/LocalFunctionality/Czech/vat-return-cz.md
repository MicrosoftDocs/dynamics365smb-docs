# VAT returns in the Czech version

The VAT return feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] lets you generate and submit VAT returns to the “Moje daně” portal. The lines on the VAT return are created based on the settings in the VAT statement. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies whether a regular VAT return was already created for the period. However, because there can be multiple corrective and other returns for a given period, this data isn't checked. This feature allows you to save the VAT return, and you have immediate access to it for future reference.
