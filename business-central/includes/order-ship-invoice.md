> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you post a sales order, you create a shipment and an invoice. These documents can be done at the same time or independently. You can also create a partial shipment and a partial invoice by filling in the **Qty. to Ship** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual sales order lines before you post. Note that you cannot create an invoice from the **Sales Orders** page for something that has not shipped. That is, before you can invoice, you must have recorded a shipment, or you must choose to ship and invoice at the same time.
>
> In case you need to invoice a sale without registering a shipment in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)], create the document on the **Sales Invoices** page, or choose the **Make Invoice** action on the **Sales Quotes** page. Learn more at [Invoice Sales](../sales-how-invoice-sales.md).
