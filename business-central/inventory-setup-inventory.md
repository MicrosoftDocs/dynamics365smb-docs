# Setting Up Inventory
Before you can manage warehouse activities and inventory costing, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's inventory policies.

You can provide better customer service and optimize your supply chain by organizing your inventory at different addresses. You can then buy, store, or sell items at different locations and transfer inventory between them.

When you have set up your inventory, you can manage various processes related to item transactions. For more information, see [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md) and [Warehouse Management](warehouse-manage-warehouse.md).
