# Account Schedules Overview

Account schedules are one of the main tools that you can use to provide information for required statutory reports. By using user-defined rows and columns, you can decide which data you want to compare and how. This means that you can create as many customized financial statements as you want without using Report Designer. You can also choose to use a predefined column layout for any account schedule.

To better manage the report data, you can:

- Create general ledger correspondence.
- Create constants.
- Create extensions.
- Create expressions.

Account schedules are set up in the **Account Schedules** window.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to print the following reports to review the general ledger account information that you will be using in account schedules:
>
> **G/L Account Turnover** report
> **G/L Account Card** report
> **G/L Account Entries Analysis** report
