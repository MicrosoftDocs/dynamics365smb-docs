# Set Up General Inventory Information
You specify your general inventory setup on the **Inventory Setup** page.

## To set up general inventory information
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

For detailed information about the costing fields, **Automatic Cost Posting** and **Expected Cost Posting to G/L**, see [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md) and [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).

If you want to include warehouse handling time in the order promising calculation on the purchase line, you can set it up as a default for the inventory, on the **Inventory Setup** page, and for your location. For more information, see [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).
