# General Business Functionality

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance and sales. For more information, see [Business Functionality](across-business-functionality.md).

To support those business area-specific tasks, you can use various general business functionalities, such as defining extended text for document lines and organizing connecting business tasks in workflows.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the business-related functions described in this section, you will use general UI functions every day to interact with the system. For more information, see [Work with Business Central](ui-work-product.md).

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]
