## How to use the report

- Executives

As an executive, you can utilize the Liabilities report to evaluate your company's financial position before engaging in a new expansive initiative. By first analyzing current liabilities you can gauge the immediate debt burden on the organization. This helps you determine if there are enough liquid assets to meet short term obligations, ensuring you have sufficient cash-flow to support existing operations and a new development. 

Next you could asses the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios. These key performance indicators provide insight into the company's leverage and risk profile. For example a high debt-to-equity ratio could indicate that the company has a high reliance on borrowed funds. This type of data can help inform how you decide to finance the expansion project.
