# Payment scenarios

Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo, a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).
