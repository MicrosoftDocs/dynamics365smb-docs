# Copy Existing Items to Create New Items
When you add a new item, to save time, you can use the **Copy Item** function to copy an existing item to use as a template for a new item.  

## To copy an existing item to a new item  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the item that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Item** action.  
3. On the **Copy Item** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can enter a specific item number in the **Target Item No.** field that you want the new item to get. Alternatively, you can select an existing number series in the **Target No. Series** field. The new item will then be assigned the next available number in that number series.  

5. To copy your selections to the new item, choose the **OK** button.
