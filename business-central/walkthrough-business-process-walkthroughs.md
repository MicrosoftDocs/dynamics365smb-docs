# Business Process Walkthroughs
This selection of walkthroughs provides step-by-step, end-to-end business processes that you can perform using the CRONUS International Ltd. demonstration company. The walkthroughs consist of multiple procedures, some of which would normally be performed by one user, while others incorporate several different user roles. In order to simulate the working environment, some of the walkthroughs contain setup steps necessary to complete the exercises as described. These steps can provide insight into the kind of information users need to share with their company's IT professionals.  

 The walkthroughs are complete scenarios, and should be performed from beginning to end for the greatest benefit. Many are based on [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] demonstrations, and enable you to try those procedures yourself, at your own pace.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the walkthroughs use demonstration data that is not available in the standard CRONUS company. For those walkthroughs, you must perform the steps in a company created from the **Full Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option, which is available in the Sandbox environment. For more information, see [Creating a Sandbox Environment](across-how-create-sandbox-environment.md).
