# Work with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Data in Power BI

In this article, you learn some of the basics about working with reports and dashboards in Power BI that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source. The article discusses some aspects that will help you get started as a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user. For general guidelines and instructions about using Power BI, see [Power BI documentation for consumers](/power-bi/consumer).

## Get ready

Sign up for the Power BI service. If you haven't already signed up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use a work email address and password.

## Get started

Once you have a Power BI account, you can sign in at [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/).

The Power BI service hosts all the reports available to you. To see the report, select **My Workspace** > **Reports**. Then just select the report that you want to view.

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you'll automatically have a set of default reports on your workspace. If you want to create your own reports, you can use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then publish them to your workspace. For more information, see [Getting Started Building Reports in Power BI Desktop to Display [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md).

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you'll have to start from scratch by using Power BI Desktop. Optionally, Power BI reports can be distributed as files, that you can upload.

## Get the latest data

Each Power BI report is based on a dataset that gets data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sources. You want to make sure that the data in your Power BI reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing*.  Depending on how your organization has set up Power BI, refreshing might not happen automatically. There are two ways to refresh data: manually or by scheduling a refresh. Manual refreshing is done on-demand, as needed. Scheduled refreshing lets you refresh automatically at defined time intervals.

### Refresh manually

In the navigation pane, under **Datasets**, select **More options (...)** next to the dataset, then select **Refresh now**.

### Schedule a refresh

In the navigation pane, under Datasets, select More options (...) next to the dataset, then select **Schedule refresh**. Fill in the information under the **Schedule refresh** section, and select **Apply**.

For more information, see [Configure scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh)

## <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports from files

Power BI Reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have a .pbix file, you can upload the file to a workspace. To upload a report, do the following steps:

1. In your new workspace, select **Get Data**.

2. In the Files box, select **Get**.

3. Select **Local File**, navigate to where you saved the file, and select **Open**.

For more information, see [Upload the report to the service](/power-bi/paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report requires that you have a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is) work space. For more information, see [Managing Premium capacities](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-capacity-manage). 

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can also upload a report from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Work with Power BI Reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] - Upload Reports](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

## <a name="share"></a>Share reports with others

Once a report is in your workspace, you can share it with others in your organization.

To share a report, in a list reports, or in an open report, select **Share**. In the **Share report** pane, enter the full email addresses for individuals or distribution groups you want to share with. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the sharing. For more information, see [Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

> [!NOTE]
> You must have  [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type), and the people you share with do too. The content must be in a workspace in a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). For more information, see [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).
