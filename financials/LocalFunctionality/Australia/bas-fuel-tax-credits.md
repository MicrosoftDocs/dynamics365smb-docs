# BAS Fuel Tax Credits
Fuel tax credits provide companies with a credit for the fuel tax (excise or customs duty) included in the price of fuel used for business activities in:  
  
-   Machinery  
  
-   Plant  
  
-   Equipment  
  
-   Heavy vehicles  
  
 For more information on fuel tax credits, see [Fuel Tax Credits](http://www.ato.gov.au/businesses/content.aspx?menuid=0&doc=/content/76594.htm&page=2&H2).  
  
 In this release, support has been added to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] for two fields, which track and report fuel tax credits to the Australian Tax office (ATO).
