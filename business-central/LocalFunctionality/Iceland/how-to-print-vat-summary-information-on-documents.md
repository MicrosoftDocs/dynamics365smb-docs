# Print VAT Summary Information on Documents in the Icelandic Version
If VAT is calculated, VAT summary information is typically printed on sales and purchase documents. However, in Iceland, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does not print VAT summary information if only one VAT sales code is used in the document. You can modify this behavior by using the **Always Show VAT Summary** option.  

The following procedure describes how to display VAT summary information on a sales invoice document, but the same steps also apply to sales order confirmations, sales quotes, sales credit memos, blanket sales orders, purchase orders, purchase invoices, and purchase credit memos.  

## To show VAT summary information  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the list, select the relevant document, and then choose the **Print** action.  
3.  To display VAT information in the report, select the **Always Show VAT Summary** check box.
