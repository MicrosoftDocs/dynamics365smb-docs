Furthermore, as an administrator, you can monitor your tenant's health and specify upgrade windows in the [Business Central Administration Center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center).  

Databases are protected by automatic backups that are retained for 30 days. As an administrator, you cannot access or manage these backups because they are managed automatically by Microsoft. For more information about the underlying technology, see [Automatic backups](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups).
