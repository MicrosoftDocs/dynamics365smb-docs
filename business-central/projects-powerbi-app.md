# Projects Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

## Project Analytics for the Leadership Team

To fit this category you might have a role such as:
- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: View Project Costing Performance
As a CFO, you want to ensure that you are not overspending on specfic projects from a high-level. By analzying the [Project Performance to Budget](projects-powerbi-project-performance-to-budget.md), you can quickly see how each project is performing against their budget. Alternatively, you can also use the [Project Profitability](projects-powerbi-project-profitability.md) and view key information on profit statics per project.


## Project Analytics for the Project Managers
To fit this category you might have a role such as:
- Project Manager

### Example scenario: Tracking Project Completion and Sales
As a Project Manager, you want to be able to view how each project is performing and get a high-level information on them all. With the [Project Overview](projects-powerbi-project-overview.md) report you can do that as this compares key information across all projects. Additionally, you can also see how your sales are going by viewing either the [Project Invoiced Sales by Type](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-type.md) or the [Project Invoiced Sales by Customer](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-customer.md) can show you clear sales information.
