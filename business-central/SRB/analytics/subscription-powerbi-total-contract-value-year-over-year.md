# Total Contract Value Year-Over-Year (Power BI Report)

The **Total Contract Value Year-Over-Year** report visualizes how total contract value develops month-over-month and compares it against the previous year. It helps users assess subscription portfolio growth, customer activity trends, and overall contract value performance across fiscal periods.

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and subscription managers.

Total Contract Value (TCV) is a critical KPI for any subscription-based business. It represents the total committed revenue expected from your customers over the entire duration of their contractual terms. This includes both currently active contracts and future commitments that are signed and recorded in Business Central but have not yet reached their contract start date. By visualizing what your organization can expect to earn based on these formal commitments, TCV serves as a primary indicator of future cash flow and long-term business health.

Subscription managers can use this report to evaluate the strength of the contract portfolio over time. By comparing TCV and Active Customers against the previous year (PY), you can quickly see if your growth is driven by acquiring new customers or by increasing the value of existing contracts.

The detailed table provides the TCV Delta vs. PY, allowing you to pinpoint exactly when and where the portfolio value fluctuates. This visibility can helps you identify seasonal trends in renewals or potential churn risks, enabling you to adjust your retention strategies and ensure a stable, growing recurring revenue stream throughout the fiscal year.
