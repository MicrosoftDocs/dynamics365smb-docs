# Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with Common Data Service
This article provides an overview of how to set up the user accounts that are required to integrate [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

## Setting Up the Administrator User Account
You must add your administrator user account for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as a user in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. When you set up the connection between [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] we will use this account one time to install and configure some required components. <!--Verify this-->

## Setting Up the User Account for the Integration
You must create a dedicated user account in your Office 365 subscription that both [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] can use to synchronize data. This user account must be able to sign in to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)], which means this user must have a license for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and at least one security role assigned to it in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. <!--not sure that this applies as described [here](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#create-a-user-account). For more information about how to create users in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)], see [Manage security, users, and teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616518). --> After the connection is set up, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will assign the user account the security roles that it needs in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

<!--![Assisted setup guide showing place to enter synchronization user credentials](media/sync-user-setup.png "Visualization assisted setup wizard page showing place to enter synchronization user credentials")-->

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not use the administrator account for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for synchronization. Doing so will break the synchronization.

## Permissions and Security Roles for User Accounts in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)]
When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the CDS Base Integration Solution by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Common Data Service Connection Setup** page. The Business Central CDS Integration security role is deployed.


<!--
The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
