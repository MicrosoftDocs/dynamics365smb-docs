# VAT exchange rate in the Czech version

The exchange rate is located in documents, but the Czech Republic requires the possibility to set different exchange rates for posting and VAT in sales and purchase documents. This feature adds the VAT Currency Code field and VAT Exchange Rate in documents. Users can change the exchange rate for VAT before document posting.
