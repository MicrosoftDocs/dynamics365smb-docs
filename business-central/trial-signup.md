# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

Business Central offers a free trial. After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## To sign up for the trial

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

- [Overview of business functionality](across-business-functionality.md)  
- [Get started](ui-get-ready-business.md#get-started)  
- [Get productive](ui-work-product.md)  
- [Quick starts](quick-start-business-central.md)  

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).
