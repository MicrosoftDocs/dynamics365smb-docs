# Power Bi Subscription Billing app

The Power BI Subscription Billing app delivers insight into the performance and health of your subscription business. It brings together the key metrics that define recurring revenue models, from monthly growth and churn to long-term contract value.

Executives and leadership teams can track overall growth and stability of their subscription business with the Subscription Overview, Revenue Year-over-Year and Total Contract Value Year-over-Year reports.

Finance and operations managers can dig deeper into the drivers of change. With the Revenue Development report that separates churn, upgrades, downgrades, and new business, they can explain why revenue is changing month by month. The Revenue Forecast report supports planning by providing a forward-looking view of recurring revenue.

Subscription managers, sales, and accounting teams can use reports for their daily work. Customer Deferrals and Vendor Deferrals reports allow them to validate that revenue and costs are recognized correctly, while the Billing Schedule report helps confirm that all contracts are invoiced as expected.

The following examples illustrate how different roles can use the reports in the app to support both strategic decisions and daily operations.
