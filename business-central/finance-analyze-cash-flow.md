# Analyze cash flow in your company
The charts on the Accountant Role Center provide insights that can help you make solid decisions about what to do with your cash.  

| To answer questions like these | Use this chart |
| --- | --- |
| How long does the sales process tie up my cash?</br> Should I increase or reduce inventory levels? |Cash Cycle |
| When did cash move in and out of my company?</br> Are some periods better than others? |Cash Flow |
| Do the numbers seem off for a period?</br> Should I investigate? |Income & Expense |
| When might a cash surplus or deficit happens?</br> Should I pay down debt, or borrow to meet upcoming expenses? |Cash Flow Forecasts |

On the Accountant Role Center, under **Finance Performance**, the **Cash Cycle**, **Cash Flow**, and **Income & Expense** charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:  

* See figures for a period by using the timeline slider.  
* Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.  
* Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the **Finance Performance** drop down.  
* View the entries by choosing a point in the chart. For example, a point on the timeline or a column segment. If the numbers seem off, this is where you can make adjustments.  

Although it's separate, the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart is similar. You view details, filter results, and change what is displayed in the same ways. If you change a setting, you can refresh the forecast by choosing **Cash Flow Forecast**, and then **Recalculate Forecast**.

If you want to examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:

* Handles confirmed sales and purchases.  
* Subtracts payables and adds receivables.  
* Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.

2. Choose a cash flow forecast, and then choose the **Cash Flow Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Cash Flow Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Worksheet Lines** action.
