# Personal security best practices for Business Central users

As a Business Central user, your personal security practices play a crucial role in protecting both your own data and your organization's information. While Business Central provides robust security features, the human element remains one of the most important factors in maintaining a secure environment. This article outlines essential security practices that every user should follow to minimize risks and protect against common threats like phishing, unauthorized access, and data loss.

## Key practices

- **Think before you click:** Emphasize phishing awareness: Don't trust unsolicited emails or links that seem "too good" or urgent; if something feels off, double-check with IT.
- **Enable MFA everywhere:** Enable two factor authentication on your accounts (Business Central and others) for improved security.
- **Keep software updated** Apply updates to their devices and apps regularly (via official channels) to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Use a password manager:** Use a reputable password manager to generate and store strong unique passwords, rather than reusing or writing them down.
- **Avoid Using Admin Accounts Daily:** If you have a privileged account like an admin or SUPER user, create a separate regular user account for day-to-day work.
- **Remove unneeded apps/extensions:** Uninstall software or browser add-ons you don't need, to reduce attack surface.
- **Backup important data:** Use a "3-2-1" backup rule: at least one local backup, one cloud backup, and one offline (disconnected) backup. Also note that services like OneDrive have ransomware detection and recovery features&mdash;but you should still test your backups periodically.
- **Protect devices:** Use measures like enabling full-disk encryption (BitLocker on Windows, FileVault on Mac), using strong passcodes for mobile devices (and biometric unlock for convenience + security), and even covering webcams when not in use (as an extra privacy precaution).
- **Safe browsing habits:** Use ad-blockers or privacy filters to avoid malicious ads, and use a secure network (VPN when on public Wi-Fi, but avoid free VPNs).
