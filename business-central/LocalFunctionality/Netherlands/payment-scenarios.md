# Payment scenarios
Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1.  The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo.  

    For more information, see [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

2.  The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign.  

    For more information, see [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  

3.  The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), while the invoice/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency.  

    For more information, see [Payment Scenario 3 - Foreign Payment (LCY  to FCY)](payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).
