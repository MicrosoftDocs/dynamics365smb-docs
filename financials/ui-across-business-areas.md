# General Business Functionality
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance and sales. And to support your business area-specific tasks, you can use a variety of general business functionality, such as **Number Series** and **Extensions**, which is available across these areas.

The following table lists these general business areas with links to topics that describe them.
