# Intelligent Cloud Extensions for Cloud Migration

This extension will connect your data from [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] on-premises with [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] online for purposes of migrating your solution to the cloud.  

If you are using one of the supported on-premises products, you can configure your cloud environment based on a product-specific extension. Once your cloud environment is configured, you will be able to migrate data from your on-premises solution to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. This will enable you to take full advantage of what the cloud has to offer your business such as, enhanced insights into your business, artificial intelligence, multiple device access, and anytime, anywhere access.  

## Business Central on-premises
If you are using an on-premises deployment of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], get the **Intelligent Cloud Base** extension and the **Business Central Intelligent Cloud** extension, and then run the **Cloud Migration Setup** assisted setup guide.  

## Dynamics GP

## Dynamics SL
If you are using Dynamics SL, get the **Intelligent Cloud Base Extension** extension, the **Microsoft Dynamics SL Intelligent Cloud** extension and the **Microsoft Dynamics SL History Smartlists** extension, and then run the **Cloud Migration Setup** assisted setup guide.
