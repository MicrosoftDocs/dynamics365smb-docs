# Modern search in the Czech version

Giving users fast access to data is key. This feature adds a modern search option on lists in the Czech version. Modern search focuses exclusively on columns that are enhanced with full-text search capability. It accelerates the search process and delivers more precise, relevant results, which increases user satisfaction and productivity. However, you can continue to use the older method, if needed.
