## Use the report

The Revenue Year-over-Year report helps you compare monthly recurring revenue (MRR) across months and against the previous year. Alongside revenue trends, the report also shows monthly churn, making it easy to spot when cancellations are affecting growth. If churn rises unexpectedly, you can take action to improve customer retention, adjust renewal strategies, or focus on at-risk accounts.
