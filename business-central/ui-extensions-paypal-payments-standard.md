# The PayPal Payments Standard extension

Customers continuously require higher customer service, both in terms of product quality but also in terms of delivery and payment options. The PayPal Payments Standard service helps you increase your customer service.

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, you can offer your customers to pay you through their PayPal account. When you send a sales invoice by email, there's a PayPal link in the email body and in the attached PDF document. When the customer chooses the link, the service page for their PayPal account appears to show the payment details for the sale. The customer can then pay the invoice as any other PayPal payment.

The PayPal Payments Standard service provides the following benefits:

* Customer payments arrive faster in your bank account.
* Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
* PayPal offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on web sites.
* PayPal offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, PayPal accounts, and other sources.
* The PayPal link can be added automatically to sales documents or manually by the user.
* The PayPal Payments Standard service doesn't involve monthly fees or setup fees.
* Because it's an extension, you can easily enable the PayPal Payment Standard service when and if your business requires it.
