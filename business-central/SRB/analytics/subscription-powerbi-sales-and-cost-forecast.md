# Sales and Cost Forecast (Power BI Report)

The **Sales and Cost Forecast** report provides a projection of future revenue and expenses based on your current subscription portfolio. By forecasting monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and monthly recurring cost (MRC), the report helps businesses visualize their expected financial trajectory and the long-term profitability of their subscription contracts.

## Use the report

The report is meant for financial controllers and sales managers.

Financial controllers can use this report to project future cash flows and profitability. Unlike total contract value, which focuses on committed terms, this forecast assumes that active subscriptions will continue to renew indefinitely unless a specific cancellation date has been recorded. The line chart visualizes the MRR and MRC trends over time, allowing you to see the expected margin between your subscription income and the underlying vendor costs. This is essential for long-term budgeting and identifying when your recurring revenue might decline due to known upcoming cancellations.

Sales managers can use the report to track the long-term value generated by their teams and accounts. The detailed table breaks down the forecast by salesperson, customer, and customer subscription contract, providing a granular view of future performance.

By analyzing this data, you can identify which sales representatives are managing the most stable revenue streams and which customer subscription contracts are the primary drivers of future growth. This level of detail helps you prioritize account management efforts and identify high-value customers who are nearing their "actual end date," ensuring you can proactively engage them for renewals before the forecast shows a drop in revenue.
