# Frequently Asked Questions
This section contains answers to frequently asked questions about signing up for and using [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

## What email address can I use with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up](ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.md).  

If you want to deploy [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] on-premises, then you can use other authentication methods. For more information, see [Deployment of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/deployment).  

## Do I have to buy Office 365?
No. But if you want to experience [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as fully integrated with Office 365, you can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Office 365 [here](https://products.office.com/try).  

If the account you sign up with is a non-Office 365 work account (such as joe@mysolution.com), and you have an Office 365 subscription, then you can associate your domain (mysolution.com) with the Office 365 subscription. For more information, see [Get help with Office 365 domains](/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/get-help-with-domains?view=o365-worldwide).  

If you do not have an Office 365 subscription, and you do not want to buy one, then, when you sign up, we provision a new Azure Active Directory tenant for you so that you have access to the Azure portal where you have access to advanced administration tools.  

## What is the integration with Office 365 about?
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is fully integrated with Office 365 so that you can navigate freely between Office 365 apps and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] using the app launcher. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can open data in Excel, print reports using Word, and you can work with your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] data in Outlook, for example. For more information, see [Using [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as your Business Inbox in Outlook](admin-outlook.md).  

## Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes, but depending on how you signed up to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], your data can be deleted or preserved. For more information, see [Canceling [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](admin-cancel.md).  

## Where do I go if I have questions?
If you have questions about [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] that you can't find an answer for in this documentation, you can ask the Business Central community. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central community](https://community.dynamics.com/business).  

From the community home page, you can also find links to our blogs where you can also find tips and tricks. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central Blog](https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials) and [Dynamics 365 Business Central Support Blog](https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/dynamics365financialssupport).  

Finally, you can contact your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] reselling partner. For more information, see the [How do I get technical support?](across-faq.md#how-do-i-get-technical-support-for-) section.  

## Can I extend my 30-day “New Company” trial period?
Yes. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching we will display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the **Extend Trial Period** guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose **Extend Trial** in the guide. You can extend the trial period one time yourself. After that, a Microsoft partner can extend it for another 30 days. For more information, see [Extend Your Trial Version](admin-extend-trial.md). To contact a Microsoft partner in your country or region now, see the list of phone numbers in [CustomerSource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/CRM/support/support-news/Support_Telephone#linkc).  

> [!NOTE]
> It may take up to two business days to complete the trial extension process.  

## Our administrator has moved me to another plan to give me another role, but I still see the same Role Center in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
This is a bit complicated, but it looks like your administrator didn't change your Role Center and assign user groups that match the new license. Essentially, your access to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is determined by the type of plan (license) that you have - this sets permissions and your default Role Center page. You can change your Role Center manually in My Settings, but if you are moved to another plan, such as moving you from the Business plan to the Team Members plan, you might see the old Home because your permissions were not changed.  

## Why can't I find that capability in my [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
Did you read about a new capability in the release notes or on our blog recently? In that case, your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] might not have been upgraded to the latest version yet. If the capability is published as an extension in AppSource, then there is a delay between the extension being announced and its availability in AppSource.  

## Can I get training in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?
Yes, you can. But currently, you have to ask your reselling partner. If you don't know who that is, find a Business Central partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page.  

If you have access to Microsoft CustomerSource, you can get access to the Imagine Academy site with  eLearning material. For more information on how to get access, see the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 training](/dynamics365/get-started/training/index#dynamics-365-customers) page.  

## Is [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] available in my country?

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is available in a limited number of markets, but new countries are added through Microsoft-led localization or through partner-led localization on a quarterly basis. For more information, see [Countries and Translations Supported](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  

## How do I get technical support for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]?

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is sold through partners, and you should contact your reselling partner to get help with technical problems. If your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] partner then cannot resolve the problem, they will raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  

If you have signed up for a trial and have not yet purchased [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you do not have a reselling partner, and you cannot contact the Microsoft support team.  

You can find a Business Central partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page.  

## Why does Help describe functionality that I cannot access?
If your Experience setting on the **Company Information** page is set to **Essential**, then UI elements for the Manufacturing and Service Management features are not visible to you because they require the **Premium** experience. A text note is inserted in high-level help topics for these feature areas. For more information, see [Changing Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).
