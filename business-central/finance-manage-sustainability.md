# Sustainability management overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This feature will be available in Business Central from the **2024 release wave 1**, and all reference links will be enabled once they are available.

Business Central offers a feature that helps you monitor and manage your organization's impact on the environment. This feature is designed to oversee and regulate an organization's environmental footprint by tracking various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, facilitating proper insights. It supports the basic process of collecting emission data via sustainability journals, allowing for manual entry of known data, or utilizing built-in methods for calculating emissions footprints. 

>[!NOTE]
>This initial release serves as a foundational step and is entirely independent of other Business Central features. However, future iterations will aim to integrate more closely, potentially automating certain manual processes.

The first version focuses on GHG emissions, and there are three emissions scopes defined by the ESG standard:  

- **Scope 1 emissions**: include emissions that are emitted from stationery and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.  
- **Scope 2 emissions**: include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.   
- **Scope 3 emissions**: include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, fuel and energy related activities, upstream and downstream transportation, generated waste, business travel and employee commuting, etc. 

With this feature, you can:   

- Set up emission factors for different sources and categories of GHG emissions. 
- Record emission data in sustainability journals, either manually or by using predefined calculation methods.  
- Post emission entries to the sustainability ledger, where you can view and analyze the emission data by various dimensions. 
- Generate sustainability reports that show your organization's GHG emissions performance.
