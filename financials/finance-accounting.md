# Accountant Experiences in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
Any business must do its books and sign off on the accounting. Some businesses employ an external accountant, and others have an accountant on staff. No matter which type of accountant you are, you can use the **Accountant** Role Center as your Home in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. From here, you can access all windows that you need in your work.  

## Accountant Role Center
The Role Center is a dashboard with activity tiles that show you real-time key figures and give you quick access to data. In the ribbon at the top of the window, you have access to more actions, such as opening the most commonly used financial reports and statements in Excel. In the navigation pane to the left, you can quickly switch between the lists you use most often. If you expand the **Home** menu in the navigation pane, you will see other areas, such as **Posted Documents** with the various types of documents that the company has posted.  

If you are new to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can launch a list of videos right from your Home page. You can also launch a **Getting Started** tour that points out key areas.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  This functionality requires that the experience is set to **Suite**. For more information, see [Customizing Your Dynamics 365 Experience](ui-experiences.md).  

### Get Invited to a Client's [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
A company who use [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] can invite you to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] as their external accountant. This requires that they have set up SMTP mail, so they might want to contact their [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] partner for assistance. For more information, see [Invite Your External Accountant](finance-invite-external-accountant.md). Also, we recommend that you give them the email address that you plan to use for your accounting work - that way, you can choose if you want to use *me@accountant.com* or *me@client.com*  

As a result, you may receive two emails:

-   One from Microsoft Invitations with a link to add yourself to your client's organization  
-   One from your client with a link to their [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]  

You can then access their financial data from the **Accountant** Role Center. If you use the **Accountant Portal** extension, you can also add that client to your list of clients in the accountant portal dashboard.  

## Accountant Hub
If you are an accountant with several clients, you can use [!INCLUDE[d365acc_long](includes/d365acc_long_md.md)] for a better overview of your clients. From there, you can access each client's tenant in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and use the Accountant Role Center as described above. For more information see [Welcome to [!INCLUDE[d365acc_long](includes/d365acc_long_md.md)]](/dynamics365/accountant/index).
