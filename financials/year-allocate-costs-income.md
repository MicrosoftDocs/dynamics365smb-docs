# Overview of Tasks to Allocate Costs and Income
You can allocate an entry in a general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be made by three different methods:

* Quantity
* Percentage (%)
* Amount

The allocation features can be used with recurring journals and in fixed assets journals.
<!--You can also distribute the cost or revenue of a line to an intercompany partner when you post a sales or purchase document. When you post the document, a line will be posted in your general journal, and a corresponding line will be created in the intercompany outbox.-->

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them. These tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed.
