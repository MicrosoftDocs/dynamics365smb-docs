# Business Functionality
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides functionality for common business processes in small and mid-sized companies, mainly within wholesale and professional services.

The Sales, Purchasing, and Inventory application areas also support common supply chain processes, although limited to the needs of wholesale and distribution companies without managed warehouse handling. For more information, see [Supply Chain](madeira-supply-chain.md).

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] includes standard configurations for most business processes, but you can change the configuration to suit your business' needs. From your Home page, you can access assisted setup guides that help you configure certain scenarios and add features to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Several areas of business functionality must be set up manually. For more information, see [Setting Up [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](setup.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
