# Edit Posted Documents
Sometimes you have to update a posted document because information that is relevant to the document has changed. On a posted sales document, this can be the shipping agent's package tracking number, for example. On a posted purchase document, this can be a payment reference text.

You perform the change on an editable version of the original document, indicated by "**- Update**" in the page title. The page contains a subset of the fields on the original document, of which some are non-editable fields that are shown for information only.

The functionality is available for the following documents in all country versions:
- Posted Sales Shipment
- Posted Purchase Invoice
- Posted Return Shipment
- Posted Return Receipt

The following additional documents can be edited in selected country versions:
- ES: Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- APAC: Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- RU: Posted Sales Credit Memo
- IT: Posted Transfer Shipment, Posted Service Shipment

## To edit a posted sales shipment
