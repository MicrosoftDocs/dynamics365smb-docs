# Cancel payments in the Norwegian version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Norwegian enhancements that allow you to cancel payments. Iin the event that the payment is sent to the bank, it's necessary to contact the bank to cancel the remittance that was received.  

- A payment order can be canceled if the payments aren't received by the bank and a new remittance must be made. You can also cancel a payment order if you don't want to transfer the payments to the bank, for example if the payments are incorrect. Only open payment orders can be canceled.  

- An individual payment can be canceled if the payment can't be processed by the bank and a new remittance has to be made. You can also cancel a payment if you don't want to process the payment. Settled payments can't be canceled.
