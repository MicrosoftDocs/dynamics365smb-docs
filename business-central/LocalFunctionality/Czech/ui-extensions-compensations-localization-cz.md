# Compensation localization extension for the Czech version

The Compensation extension helps offset receivables and payables. Compensations are used when a customer is also a vendor. You can manually enter the entries to count on the **Compensation Card** page. In addition, there are functions to mark the entries to count and recalculate the balance.  

There's also a print-out of the **Agreement on Mutual Settlement of Receivables and Payables** under Czech legislation.

## Key features

- **View Balance as Vendor/Balance as Customer** – To view the balance as vendor on a customer card and the balance as customer on a vendor card, you must set a customer and vendor business relation with a contact to indicate that even though particular company is registered as a vendor and as a customer, it's in fact the same company.
- **Compensation Setup** – **Compensation Nos.**, **Compensation Bal. Account No.**, and so on
- **Compensation Card** – Lines for compensation
- Function - **Suggest lines for compensation**, **Release**
- **Agreement on Mutual Settlement of Receivables and Payables** printout
- **Compensation posting** – Posted compensation is created, and applications for entries are posted.

## Compensation setup

To use the compensation features, you must set the basic parameters that relate to the compensation balancing account number to post the credits to. If needed, you can also set the maximum rounding amount for the compensation, and specify the debit rounding account and credit rounding account to use.
