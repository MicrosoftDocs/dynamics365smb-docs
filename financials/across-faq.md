# Frequently Asked Questions
This section contains answers to frequently asked questions about signing up for and using Dynamics 365 for Financials.  

## What email address can I use with Financials?
Financials requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. Financials does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up](ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.md).  

## Do I have to buy Office 365?
No. But if you want to experience Financials as fully integrated with Office 365, you can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Office 365 [here](https://products.office.com/try).  

## What is the integration with Office 365 about?
Financials is fully integrated with Office 365 so that you can navigate freely between Office 365 apps and Financials using the app launcher. In Financials, you can open data in Excel, print reports using Word, and you can work with your Financials data in Outlook, for example. For more information, see [Using Dynamics 365 for Financials as your Business Inbox in Outlook](madeira-outlook.md).  

## Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes, but depending on how you signed up to Financials, your data can be deleted or preserved. For more information, see [Canceling Dynamics 365 for Financials](madeira-cancel.md).  

## Where do I go if I have questions?
If you have questions about Financials that you can't find an answer for in [the Learn articles](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=784954), you can ask the [Dynamics 365, Business edition community](https://community.dynamics.com/business). Also, our Support team post tips and tricks [on their blog](blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dyn365finsupport.md).  

## Is it possible to extend my 30-day “New Company” trial period?
Yes. If you want to extend your trial, you should contact Microsoft at 1-888-477-7989 (US) or 1-800-741-9206 (Canada). NOTE:  It may take up to 2 business days to complete the trial extension process.  

## Our administrator has moved me to another plan to give me another role, but I still see the same Home page in Financials?
This is a bit complicated, but it looks like your administrator didn't change your Role Center and assign user groups that match the new license. Essentially, your access to Financials is determined by the type of plan (license) that you have - this sets permissions and your default Home page. You can change your Role Center manually in My Settings, but if you are moved to another plan, such as moving you from the Business plan to the Team Members plan, you might see the old Home because your permissions were not changed.
