# Using Search for Page or Report
You can find pages and reports by choosing the **Search for Page or Report** icon in the top right corner of the address bar. Look for this icon:

![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/searchpageorreport.png "Search for Page or Report")

When you start typing characters, a drop-down list shows page names containing the character(s) you type. The drop-down list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct page from the list when it is displayed. The second column in the drop-down list shows the navigation paths to the found pages.

**Note:** The available pages and reports depend on the user experience you choose for your company. The **Basic** experience gives access to fewer than the **Suite** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the Basic experience. For more information, see [[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

**Note**: The **Search for Page or Report** function does not search through data, such as customer names, addresses, or transactions. Instead, you can search for data in list pages by choosing the magnifier symbol in the right corner of the list header. The search applies only to the list you are viewing. For information on using this type of search, see [Entering Criteria in Filters](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
