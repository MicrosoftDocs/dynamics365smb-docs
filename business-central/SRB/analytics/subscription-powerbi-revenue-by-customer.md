# Revenue by Customer (Power BI Report)

The **Revenue by Customer** report provides a detailed overview of monthly recurring revenue (MRR) by customer. It helps users understand which customers contribute the most to recurring income and how profitable each customer relationship is.

## Use the report

This report is intended for users who want to understand how monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is distributed across customers.

Executives and leadership teams use the report to identify the customers that generate the highest monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and to understand how recurring revenue is distributed across the customer base. This helps assess revenue concentration, customer dependency, and overall revenue stability.

Sales and account managers can use the report to monitor MRR, profitability, and churn per customer. They can filter the report page to a specific period of interest and apply sorting to spot customers with the highest profit or churn in that period.
