## To copy existing items to new items  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the item that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Item** action.  
3.  In the **Item Copy** window, fill in the fields as described in the following table.
