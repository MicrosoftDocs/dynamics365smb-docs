# Manage human resources

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can keep detailed records of your employees. You can register and maintain employee information, such as employment contracts, confidential information, qualifications, and employee contacts.

You can also register employee absences, which allows you to analyze registered absences as necessary.

To start using the Human Resources functionality, you must set up employees and other basic information. You can then associate various codes to an employee, which allows you to filter information for specific employees.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

| To | See |
