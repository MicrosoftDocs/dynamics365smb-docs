# Set up advance payments in the Czech version

## Advance letter templates

2. Select the VAT posting group combination you want to configure, and choose **Edit**.

    - **Sales Advance Letter VAT Account** / **Purchase Advance Letter VAT Account** – G/L account for the advance VAT amount.

    The **VAT Document** or **Credit Memo** post to these two accounts.  
    The **Advance Letter Account** might or might not be the same as the **Advance Letter G/L Account** defined in the template. The **Advance Letter VAT Account** is used exclusively for VAT tracking.

VAT entries from advances are automatically included in the VAT statement, and no separate lines are needed for them.
