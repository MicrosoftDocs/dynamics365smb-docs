# Fixed Asset Turnover

The fixed asset turnover feature enables you to: 

- Control the turnover of fixed assets or certain groups of fixed assets.
- View useful information about fixed assets in one place.
- Compare the posting of one fixed asset in different fixed asset depreciation books.
- Post fixed assets financial results monitoring. 

The following reports and windows are part of fixed assets: 

- **FA Turnover** report
- **Comparing Depr. Book Entries** report
- **FA Sheet** window
- **FA G/L Turnover** window
- **Fixed Asset G/L Turnover** report

 

## Fixed Asset Turnover Report 

The **FA Turnover** report shows the fixed asset turnover. Use the report to view information such as the fixed asset name, quantity, status, depreciation dates, and amounts. The report can be used as documentation for the correction of quantities or for auditing.

 

## Comparing Depreciation Book Entries Report 

The **Comparing Depr. Book Entries** report shows the amounts of fixed asset operations of the main types in two selected depreciation books for all selected fixed assets. You can view the amounts of the acquisition cost, write-down, appreciation, and depreciation. The report can be used for auditing the posting of fixed asset operations.

 

## Fixed Asset Sheet Window

The **FA Sheet** window shows information similar to the **FA Turnover** report, but in a window. It has some differences in the options set, in extra filtering functionality, and in fields in the layout. The window shows fixed asset turnover. It runs on the basis of fixed asset depreciation books.

 

## Fixed Asset General Ledger Turnover Window 

The **FA G/L Turnover** window shows financial turnover as a result of fixed asset posting. General ledger entries are the basis for amounts shown in the window. You can define what is shown in the window by setting filters.

 

## Fixed Asset General Ledger Turnover Report

The **Fixed Asset G/L Turnover** report is similar to the **FA G/L Turnover** window, but it is in a printing layout, and has differences in the options and in the information and fields that can be shown in the layout. You can define what is included in the report by setting filters.
