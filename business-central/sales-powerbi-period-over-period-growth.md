## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs are responsible for making strategic decisions that drive growth for organizations. The report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. By comparing sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, you might notice that sales consistently declined in a particular region or product category. You can use this information to make decisions about investments or changes to your sales strategy. Changes might include increasing your marketing efforts in that region, or improving your product offerings to be more competitive.

For sales managers who oversee daily sales activities, the report can help you identify areas where the sales team is excelling, and areas where they need more support. By analyzing the growth amount and growth percentage, you can evaluate your team's performance over the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust sales strategies, coach team members, and improve overall sales performance.
