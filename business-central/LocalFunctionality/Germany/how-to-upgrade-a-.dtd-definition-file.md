# Upgrade a .DTD definition file for digital audits in the German version

You can explicitly validate a .dtd file after you import one in order to address upgrade issues. This is useful when you have an existing setup that needs to be updated to reflect the current version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## To upgrade and validate a .dtd file  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exports**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
3. Set up a record definition, and choose the **Import** action.  
4. Select a file to import, and then choose the **Validate** action.
