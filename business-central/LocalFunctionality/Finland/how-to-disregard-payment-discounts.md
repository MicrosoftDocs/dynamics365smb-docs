# Disregard Payment Discounts
Use the disregard payment discount at full payment feature to accept payments when the following conditions are true:  

- Payment discount date < payment date <= payment tolerance date  
- Full amount >= payment amount >= full amount - payment discount  

## To disregard a payment discount  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the line with the payment term for which you want to activate or deactivate payment discounts.  
3.  Select the **Disreg. Pmt. Disc. at Full Pmt** check box to initiate activation for this feature. To deactivate, clear the check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you apply one payment to multiple invoices, the feature to ignore payment discount at full payment is not supported.
