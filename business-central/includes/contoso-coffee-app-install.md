To use the Contoso Coffee demo data, you must install two apps in the relevant company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]:  <br><br>
- **Contoso Coffee Demo Dataset**  
    This app delivers demo data for the base application.  
- **Contoso Coffee Demo Dataset (country ID)**  
    This app adds country-specific content on top of the base application.
<br><br>
Add the apps to an company in a paid subscription or as part of a trial. Add the apps from the [marketplace](../ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md#install) if they are not already listed in the **Extension Management** page.
