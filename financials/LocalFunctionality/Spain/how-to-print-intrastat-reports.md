# How to: Print Intrastat Reports
All European Union (EU) companies must submit an Intrastat statistics report to the Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE) detailing their trade with other EU countries/regions. Companies do not have to submit statistical declarations for the Intrastat system if their import and export totals are lower than the threshold set by their country/region.  
  
 You can print and send required trade information in a file format approved by the tax authorities.  
  
### To print an Intrastat checklist  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.
