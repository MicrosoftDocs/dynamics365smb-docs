# Print test reports for delivery reminders in the Austrian version

After you create delivery reminders and made any needed modifications, you can either print the test reports or issue the delivery reminders.  

A test report is a document that lets you review and modify a delivery reminder before you issue it.  

## To print test reports before issuing delivery reminders  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Delivery Reminder List** page, choose the **Delivery Reminder - Test** action.  
3.  On the **Delivery Reminder - Test** page, set a filter if you want to print only selected delivery reminders.  
4.  Choose the **Print** button to print the report, or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.
