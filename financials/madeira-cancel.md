# Unsubscribe, Remove, or Reset [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]
When you have signed up for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], you can choose to cancel your subscription at any time. Similarly, you can choose to reset the company that you can been using in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For a quick overview, see [the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] blog](https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials/archive/2016/11/28/how-long-is-the-trial-period-and-how-do-i-cancel).  

## Unsubscribing by removing [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your Office 365 experience
If you have subscribed for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] using an existing Office 365 business account, you must ask your Office 365 administrator to remove the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] license from your user account.  
User accounts and licenses are managed in the [Office Portal](https://portal.office.com). Only administrators can remove [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] licenses from user accounts. The Office 365 administrator can remove [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your user account or remove the subscription from your company's account. If [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is removed from your user account, and other people from your company continue the subscription, they will still have access to your shared data in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] company.  

## Unsubscribing from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] without Office 365
If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] using a non-Office 365 business account, you do not have an Office 365 administrator. Instead, you must unsubscribe by contacting the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Cancelation team. Currently, you must contact the team by sending an email message at cancel-madeira@microsoft.com. You must include the name of your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] tenant in the message so that we can identify you. The easiest way to do that is to copy the URL from your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] home page.  

## Resetting your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] experience
If you have added data to your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] preview and you want to start over with a fresh experience, you can create a new company and then reset the first company. If you open the **Companies** page, you can create a copy of your current company, sign out and then sign into your new company, and then reset the original company.  
> [!NOTE]  
>   When you reset a company that you are sharing with other people from your organization, you must make sure other people are not logged in when you reset the company.  

## Removing [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your app launcher
If you want to hide [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] from your app launcher, you can quite simply unpin it. This does not remove any data, and it does not cancel your subscription.
