# Norwegian Sales Documents
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports two sets of sales documents. A document set consists of a sales invoice, sales credit memo, reminder, and finance charge memo.  
  
 Set 1 is based on international reports. You cannot print Norwegian giro or use paper sources/trays in this set of reports.  
  
 Set 2 contains reports designed for use in Norway. These reports print Norwegian giro. When printing these reports, you can use paper sources/trays specified in the **Printer Selections** table.  
  
## Document Set 1  
 The first document set consists of standard reports that do not contain any settings specific to Norway. For example, giro transactions are not printed and paper sources/trays cannot be processed.  
  
 Document set 1 contains the following reports:  
  
-   **Sales - Invoice**  
  
-   **Sales - Credit Memo**  
  
-   **Reminder**  
  
-   **Finance Charge Memo**  
  
## Document Set 2  
 The second document set prints Norwegian giro on every page. The giro on the last page contains information about the amount.  
  
 Document set 2 contains the following reports:  
  
-   **Sales - Invoice 2**  
  
-   **Sales - Credit Memo 2**  
  
-   **Reminder 2**  
  
-   **Finance Charge Memo 2**
