# Display a stockout warning

When someone enters a quantity for an item on a sales document that exceeds the item's current inventory level at the location, you might want to let them know by displaying a notification. The notification is just to inform them of the potential problem, and doesn't prevent them from creating the order.

## To show a warning about low inventory on a sales document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on whether you want to show the warning, turn on or turn off the **Stockout Warning** toggle.

## Video guidance

The following video shows a scenario where someone is creating a sales order, and the quantity exceeds the available inventory level for the item at its location.
