# Sales by Item (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Item** report gives a clear picture of your organization's item sales. It showcases key metrics for each item or item category. For example, the sales amount, quantities, and the cost amounts. You can break down the information further by the specific customers that buy the items.

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to track item sales. Sales teams can use it to better identify key items.  

CEOs might want a list of the top-selling items by revenue, and be able to compare the list with how much each item contributed to the company's overall revenue. You can use this information to make strategic decisions about which items to focus on and how to allocate resources.  

Sales managers can identify items that aren't performing and implement sales promotions for them. You can also use this information to adjust inventory levels of different items, procure extra stock to assist with demand, or reduce stock levels for slower periods.  

Salespeople can tailor their pitch based on the sales performance for specific items. The report lets you identify high-performing items. You can also use this report to gain insights on lower-performing items so salespeople can spot opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.
