# Access to the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Preview
Starting in the spring of 2018, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will become available in new countries. To ensure that [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is the right solution for those customers we're offering a preview version of the service ahead of the spring launch. The preview for Denmark became available in January, 2018, and additional markets will soon follow.  

## Getting Started with Previews and Sandboxes
Previews and sandboxes are great ways to get started with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. A preview instance contains functionality that is in addition to what's available in the current version. Previews give partners and customers the opportunity to try and provide feedback about functionality that we're thinking about releasing. Though previews are primarily intended for partners, customers are also welcome to use them for a limited time. The current preview of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] contains most of the capabilities that are available in Dynamics NAV 2018, which typically require some help from a partner to set up.

To get started with a preview, go to [this page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866045) and provide your work email address. To learn more about [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and the capabilities it offers, refer to the documentation here on this site.

You can think of a sandbox as a non-production environment that you can use on top of your production or preview instance of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. A sandbox lets you safely build and test extensions and develop new functionality to customize the service without affecting the data and settings of your production or preview instances. Right now, all customers who have a production or preview version can use a sandbox.

To learn how to get started with a sandbox, see the instructions below.

## Creating a Sandbox Environment
To work in a sandbox environment, you must have a subscription to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. There can only be one sandbox per subscription.

### Advanced Functionality Available in a Sandbox Environment
Sandboxes contain an in-client Designer feature that lets you design pages using a drag-and-drop interface and build extensions in the client itself by adding and rearranging fields.

For more information, see [Using Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav/developer/devenv-inclient-designer).

### To create a sandbox environment
1.	Sign in to your production or preview instance of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  
2.	Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sandbox Environment**, and then choose the related link.
3.	Choose **Create**. A tab will open where you can finish setting up your sandbox.

    > [!Note]
    > If pop-up blocker is enabled in your browser, change it to allow URLs from the *.financials.dynamics.com* address.  

4.	When the sandbox is ready, a Welcome page will display.  
5.	If you want to read about scenarios that you can try in a sandbox, such as how to develop extensions, choose the **Learn more** link. Otherwise, choose **Close** to continue to the Role Center of your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] sandbox instance.  
6.	At the top of the Role Center, a notification appears to inform you that this is a sandbox. You can also see the type of the environment in the title bar of the client.

    > [!Note]
    > The sandbox contains demonstration data for the fictitious CRONUS company. No data is copied or otherwise transferred from the production environment.  

7.	You can return to Sandbox Environments page at any time to reset the sandbox.

    > [!Note]
    > Resetting a sandbox removes it completely, and then recreates it with the default demonstration data.  

8.	To switch between your production environment and sandbox, use the Dynamics 365 menu or the Dynamics home page.

    > [!Note]
    > An administrator or another user can limit or even block user access to the sandbox by using the standard security features in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], such as the User card, user groups and permission sets.  

### Building New Solutions and Intellectual Property
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] offers a set of development tools and a modern platform to build on so you can create your own add-on apps and embed solutions to connect or extend [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides tools that you can use to implement your own add-on and embed functionality to add new industry-specific end-to-end experiences or integrate third-party solutions. For example, you can use an API to build a connected app to exchange data between [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] and your payroll app. Connect apps can also make use of extensions to create pages to be used for setup, configuration, or to support app-specific features. For more information, see [Developing Apps for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]](https://aka.ms/getstartedwithapps).
