# How to: Export Payments
The Payment Management module allows you to export your payments electronically via a text file or XMLport.  
  
### To export payments  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Payment Slip Setup**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  In the **Payment Class** window, select a payment class, and then, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Steps**.  
  
3.  In the **Payment Step** window, fill in the **Name** field.  
  
4.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit** to open.  
  
5.  In the **Payment Step Card** window, fill in the fields.  
  
       
  
6.  In the **Action Type** field, select **File**, and then in the **Export Type.** field, select **Report** or **XMLport**.  
  
7.  In the **Export No.** field, specify the object that will export the payments.  
  
 The next time you make a payment that is based on this payment step, the payments will be exported to a file as specified.
