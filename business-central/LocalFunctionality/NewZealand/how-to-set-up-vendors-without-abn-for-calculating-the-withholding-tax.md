# Set up vendors without IRD numbers for calculating the withholding tax

Withholding Tax (WHT) is calculated for local vendors who don't have a New Zealand Inland Revenue Department number (IRD), as required by tax law.  

## To set up vendors without IRD for calculating the withholding tax

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the required vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3.  On the **Vendor Card** page, on the **Registration** FastTab, make sure the **IRD No.** field and the **Foreign Vend** field must be empty.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The WHT percentage is automatically withheld in accordance with what was specified on the **WHT Posting Setup** page. The WHT certificate is produced for submission to the vendor. For more information, see [Withholding Tax](withholding-tax.md).
