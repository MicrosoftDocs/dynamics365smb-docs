# Create report 347 in the Spanish version
All companies must provide an annual declaration, **Report 347**, to the tax authorities providing the sales and purchase transactions from the previous fiscal period.  

The Report 347 declaration is generated in a format that tax authorities approved to upload to their Virtual Office website or submission on CD-ROM.  

Before you create the Report 347 declaration, you can run a report to identify payments in cash that isn't applied to a document.
