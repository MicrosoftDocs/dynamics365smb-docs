# Supplementary VAT Statement

According to §43 part 1 of VAT Law 235/2004, the payer can submit a supplementary VAT statement. In case the user wants to issue the **Supplementary VAT Statement** report, they must choose the **Supplementary** type of VAT statement when exporting the statement.
In the Calculate and Post VAT Settlement functionality, the posted document number is stored in closed VAT entries in the **VAT Settlement No.** field for further filtering in VAT statements and reports. This feature allows calculation and printing VAT statement for different VAT statements posted and submitted in one VAT period.
