# Add Extended Item Text
You can extend a standard text for items by adding extra lines, and you can set up conditions for use of the extra lines. You do this from item cards.

## To define extended text for an item description
1. Open the card for an item that you want to add extended text to, and then choose the **Extended Text** action.
2. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
3. Choose the **New**.
4. Fill in the **Language Code** field or select the **All Language Codes** check box if you use language codes.
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.
6. In the **Text** field, write the extended text.
7. Select relevant check boxes for the document types where you want the extended text printed.
8. Close the page.

## To add an extended item text on a sales order line
1. Open a sales order with a sales line for an item that has extended text defined. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. Select the line in question, and then choose the **Insert Ext. Text** action.
