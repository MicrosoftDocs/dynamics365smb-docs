# Cloud Migration Extensions for Migrating to Business Central Online

Depending on your on-premises solution, you must use different extensions to connect your data with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online for purposes of migrating your solution to the cloud.  

If you are using one of the supported on-premises products, you can configure your cloud environment based on a product-specific extension. Once your cloud environment is configured, you will be able to migrate data from your on-premises solution to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This will enable you to take full advantage of what the cloud has to offer your business such as, enhanced insights into your business, artificial intelligence, multiple device access, and anytime, anywhere access.
