# Iceland core app setup

Microsoft finished delocalization process of the Icelandic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] from version 24.0. New Icelandic localization will use W1 Base App and have all localization features delivered as apps. This migration isn't enabled by default and users must do it manually when they decide they want to finish this process. 

To finish the migration to new localization model, you need to follow the steps:  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Iceland Core App Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the **Enabled** field to enable the Iceland Core app.  
3. Choose **Next**. 

> [!NOTE]
> This process includes data migration, so after enabling this app, it isn't possible to switch it on again.
 
1. Select the **I accept the data update** field to confirm whether you understand the update procedure and agree to proceed. It's highly recommended to select on the **Review Affected Data** link to review affected data. 
1. Choose **Finish**.
