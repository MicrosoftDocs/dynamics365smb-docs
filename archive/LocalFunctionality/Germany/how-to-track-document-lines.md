# Track Document Lines
You can use the document tracking to view documents that are related to sales order lines and purchase order lines for orders and archived orders. You can also see an overview of documents related to order lines. This helps you to identify documents used to process orders.  

You can also track document lines using the following:  

- Quotes  
- Archived quotes  
- Posted shipments  
- Posted invoices  

The following procedure describes how to track document lines from sales orders, but the same steps also apply to purchase orders and blanket orders.

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.

3.  Select the sales order line that will be used to track documents.  
4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Document Line Tracking** action.  

    In the **Document Lines Tracking** window, you can view the number of document lines that exist for the order line.
