# How to: Export or Import Payment Management Setup Parameters
You can export or import payment management setup parameters to an external disk so that you can use the same parameters for another company with similar requirements.  
  
 You can use the following formats to export payment setup parameters:  
  
-   ETEBAC \(XMLport 10860\) – To create a bill of exchange remittance.  
  
-   Withdraw \(XMLport 10861\) – To create a customer payment withdrawal \(direct debit\).  
  
-   Transfer \(XMLport 10862\) – To create a vendor payment transfer \(credit transfer\).  
  
 You can select these formats when you set up the payment status for your payment class. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Payment Classes](../how-to-set-up-payment-classes.md).  
  
### To export or import payment management setup parameters  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Payment Slip Setup**, and then choose the relevant link.  
  
2.  In the **Payment Class** window, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Export Parameters**.  
  
     To import a parameter, choose **Import Parameter**, select the file, and then choose **Open**.  
  
3.  Choose **Save** to open the **Save As** window and navigate to the location where the file should be saved.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.
