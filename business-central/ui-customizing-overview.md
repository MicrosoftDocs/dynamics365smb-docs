> In addition to what administrators can customize, users can personalize their pages by adding, moving, or removing fields, freeze panes, parts, and more. For more information, see [Personalizing Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

Therefore, users with the **Essential** experience may in some topics read about functionality and UI elements that are not visible in their user interface.
