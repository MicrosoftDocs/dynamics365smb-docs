# Financial Reports and Analytics in Business Central

Financial reporting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives financial and business professionals the power to create, maintain, deploy, and view financial statements. Goes beyond traditional reporting constraints to help you efficiently design various types of reports. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several reports, tracing functions, and tools to help auditors or controllers who are responsible for reporting to the finance department. Financial reporting includes support for dimensions, so account segments or dimensions are immediately available; no other tools or configuration steps are required.
