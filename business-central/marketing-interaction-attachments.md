# Attachments for interactions

The files that are attached to interactions aren't attached to the interaction directly. They come from one of the following places:

* The interaction template that you used to create the interaction. Learn more in [Set up interaction templates](marketing-interactions.md#set-up-interaction-templates) for information about setting up templates.
* The segment that you created the interaction for. Learn more about segments in [Manage Interactions for Segments](marketing-interaction-segments.md).

## View attachments

Attachments are available when you view recorded interactions on the **Interaction Log Entries** page. Choose the **Show Attachments** action.

## Types of files you can attach

Attachments can be almost any type of file, such as Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel, or text files.

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Word, which lets you use features such as merge fields on Word templates. Learn more about using Word templates in [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).

## What you can do with attachments

You can perform the following actions with attachments:

- **Open**: Start the associated program—Microsoft Word, for example—and the document opens. You can then modify it.
- **Import**: Import attachments. For example, you can scan a received letter, import it, and attach it to the interaction that records the reception of that letter.
- **Export**: Export attachments to a location on a disk file.
- **Remove**: Remove the current attachment from an interaction template.
- **Copy**: Copy attachments from another interaction template.
