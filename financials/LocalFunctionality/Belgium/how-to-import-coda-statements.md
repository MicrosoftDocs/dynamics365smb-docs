# How to: Import CODA Statements
When you receive a CODA statement from your bank, you must import it into ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/how-to-set-up-bank-accounts-for-coda.md).  
  
### To import a CODA statement  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the bank account, and on the **Home** tab, in the **Progress** group, choose **Import CODA File**.  
  
3.  Enter the name of the file to import and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
 This imports the CODA statement. Next, you must process the CODA statement lines. For more information, see [How to: Apply CODA Statements](how-to-apply-coda-statements.md).
