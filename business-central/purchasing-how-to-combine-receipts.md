# Allow Receipt of More Items Than Ordered
When you receive more goods than you ordered, you may want to receive them in stead of canceling the receipt. For example, it may be cheaper to keep the excess on your inventory than returning them or your vendor may offer you a discount for keeping them.

Order processors and warehouse workers must be able to handle such "over receipts" without going through a lengthy process of preparing and getting approval for a new purchase order.

## To receive more items than specified on the purchase document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2.
