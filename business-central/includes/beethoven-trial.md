## Sign-up

### Which email address I should use to sign up?

Use your work or school email address. We'll establish your trial on your organization’s account. You can't use email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers, such as *outlook.com*, *hotmail.com*, *gmail.com*, and others.  

### What are the system requirements for the trial?

This app is a cloud-based service that doesn't require special software other than an up-to-date web browser, though some restrictions apply.  

### How do I sign up for the trial without a Microsoft 365 tenant?

You can't. Use a work or school email address.

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] is always associated with some Microsoft 365 tenant. This way, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] can recognize other applications available on your tenant, like Power BI, Excel, or Outlook, and integrate with them.

### Can I sign up for other Dynamics 365 apps such as Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service?

Yes, you can. To view all available trials, [visit the trial hub page](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics-365/free-trial). You can use the same email account to sign up for different trials.<!-- However, it is not possible to have multiple apps on the same trial site. Each trial will be on a different org and URL. The trial data won’t be shared across apps.-->

## Trial app

### I didn't receive the trial details email after signing up, what should I do?

When you sign up for the trial, you'll receive an email with the trial details. If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder. Alternatively, use the following steps to access your app:

1. Go to [the trial site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847861), choose *Finance and operations*, and then, on the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** card, choose the **Try for free** button.  
2. Enter your work or school email address. You'll be redirected to your trial app.  

### How do I add more users to a trial?

To add users, your administrator must go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). Then they can follow the [admin center guidance](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to add users up to the trial license limit. If the user you're adding already has a Microsoft 365 account, assign them the relevant license. For more information, see [Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users) in the Microsoft 365 content.

### How many users can I add to my trial environment?

You can add an unlimited number of users to the trial environment.

### How do I reset the trial environment?

You can't reset the trial environment. But ask your admin to create a fresh sandbox environment so that you can play around with the various capabilities. For more information, see [Production and Sandbox Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types) in the admin content.  

If you want to cancel [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] during a trial period, you must ask your Microsoft 365 administrator to remove the trial subscription from your company's account in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). See also [Unsubscribe or Remove [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)]](../admin-cancel.md).  

## Trial expiration and extension

### How do I extend the trial?

You can extend the trial for another trial period. For instructions, see [Need More Time to Decide Whether to Subscribe?](../admin-extend-trial.md). You can extend your trial once.
