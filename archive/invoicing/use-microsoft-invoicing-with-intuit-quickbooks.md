# Connect to Intuit QuickBooks
> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[d365inv_discont](includes/d365inv_discont.md)]

You're using Microsoft Invoicing to create and send estimates and invoices to your customers, but you might want to use another system to handle your purchases, inventory, or bookkeeping. If you're using Intuit QuickBooks, you can connect to Invoicing. QuickBooks becomes the backend system for Invoicing, and your customers and inventory items are synchronized seamlessly between the two apps. Your invoices are synchronized from Invoicing to QuickBooks but not the other way around.

## Import Contacts from QuickBooks
In Business center, it's easy to connect to QuickBooks. Start by importing your contacts from QuickBooks.

1. On the Business center home page, choose **Import your contacts**.
2. In the **Import contacts** dialog, choose **QuickBooks**. Sign in to QuickBooks with your QuickBooks account.

    > [!Note]
    > Note: If your list of customers or items is longer than 200 entries, synchronization with QuickBooks might take a while.

That's it. Your customers and items are now synchronized between Invoicing and QuickBooks. When you send an invoice from Invoicing, it will show up in QuickBooks a few minutes later.
