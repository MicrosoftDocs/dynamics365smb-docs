# Reopen Accounting Periods
When a single fiscal period has been fiscally closed it might be necessary to reopen it to post general ledger entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  After the year that the accounting period belongs to is fiscally closed, you cannot reopen it.  

## To reopen accounting periods  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  Choose the **Reopen Fiscal Period** action.  

    If more than one fiscal period is fiscally closed, the last one should be reopened. A message appears that identifies the period that should be reopened and explains the consequences of reopening it.  

3.  To fiscally open the period, choose the **Yes** button.  

When the period is reopened, the **Fiscally Closed** field is cleared, and the **Period Reopened Date** field is updated for the period.
