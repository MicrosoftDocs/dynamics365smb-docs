# How to: Set Up Locations
If you buy, store, or sell items at more than one place or warehouse, you must set each location up with a location card and define transfer routes.

You can then create document lines for a specific location, view availability by location, and transfer inventory between locations. For more information, see [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md).

**Note**: This functionality requires that your experience is set to **Suite**. For more information, see [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

## To create a location card
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **Location Card** window, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every location where you want to keep inventory.

## To create a transfer route
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Transfer Routes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Alternatively, from any **Location Card** window, choose the **Transfer Routes** action.
3. Choose the **New** action.
4. In the **Location Card** window, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can now transfer inventory items between two locations. For more information, see [How to: Transfer Inventory Between Locations](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md).
