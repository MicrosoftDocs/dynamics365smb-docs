# What's New in Dynamics 365 Business Central
Welcome to [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]! If you haven't already, then sign up for a trial, let us walk you through the basics of what you can do with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], and then try things out on your own for a while. When you are ready, you can open a blank company and set things up for yourself.  

On a regular basis, we will update [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with additional capabilities in the core application and with new [extensions](ui-extensions.md). For an overview of what is coming and what is currently available, see the [Business Central Roadmap](https://roadmap.dynamics.com/) - and remember to filter for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

On this page, you can see links to release notes, but find the latest updates in the [Business Central Roadmap](https://roadmap.dynamics.com/).
