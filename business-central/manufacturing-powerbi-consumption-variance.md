## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to monitor and manage the consumption costs of production operations.

Production supervisors use this report to track the consumption costs of production lines and ensure they operate within budget. By tracking the actual costs against the expected costs, you can quickly find and report deviations so the manufacturing manager can address them.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Consumption Variance* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [**Actual Material Cost**](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-material-cost)
- [**Expected Material Cost**](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-material-cost)
- [**Standard Material Cost**](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-material-cost)
- [**Expected Material Cost Variance**](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-material-cost-variance)
- [**Expected Material Cost Dev %**](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-material-cost-dev-percent)
- [**Standard Material Cost Variance**](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-material-cost-variance)
- [**Standard Material Cost Dev %**](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-material-cost-dev-percent)
