# Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with Microsoft Dataverse
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cc_data_platform_banner.md)]

This article provides an overview of how to set up the user accounts that are required to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Setting Up the Administrator User Account
You must add your administrator user account for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. When you set up the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] we will use this account one time to install and configure some required components. 

## Permissions and Security Roles for User Accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]
When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions are changed manually you can reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the CDS Base Integration Solution by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Common Data Service Connection Setup** page. The Business Central CDS Integration security role is deployed.

<!--
The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

### Minimum Permissions for the Administrator
The following table displays the minimum permissions on each tab for each security role that is required for the administrator user.
