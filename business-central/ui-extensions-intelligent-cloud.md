# Cloud migration base extension

This extension takes you through the process to configure a connection between your on-premises solution and your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environment when you start the migration to the cloud.  

Once the connection is configured, you can migrate data from your on-premises solution to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. This extension works with a data replication extension available for your specific on-premises solution. For more information, see [Running the Cloud Migration Tool](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migration-tool).
