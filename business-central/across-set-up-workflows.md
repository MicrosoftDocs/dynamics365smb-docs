# Setting Up Workflows
You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps. For more information, see [Using Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).  

 Before you begin to use workflows, you must set up workflow users and approval users, specify how users receive notifications about workflow steps, and then create the workflows, potentially preceded by code customization.  

 On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines from fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios that are supported by the application code.  

 If a business scenario requires a workflow event or response that is not supported, a Microsoft partner must implement them by customizing the application code. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Implementing New Workflow Events and Responses](/dynamics-nav/Walkthrough--Implementing-New-Workflow-Events-and-Responses) in the developer and IT-pro help.

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

## Example of an Approval Workflow
This video shows how to set up an workflow that will require someone to request someone else's approval before they can change information about an existing customer, or create a new customer.
