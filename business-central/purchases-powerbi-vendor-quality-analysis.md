## Use the report

This report is designed for executives, purchasing managers and purchasers, to highlight effective vendor relationships and minimize supply chain risks.

As a CEO, you want to monitor vendor performance and identify trusted vendors and supplier risks, to inform key business decisions. For example, by reviewing the vendor analysis details, you identify a vendor with the highest [Spend Reliance %](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#spend-reliance-percent) who consistently performs poorly across returns and discounts. Using these insights, you decide to pursue an alternate supplier to improve supply-chain reliability, product quality and profit metrics.

For purchasing managers, you want to track vendor performance and item dependence, to ensure a reliable supply-chain pipeline. Using the vendor reliance analysis, you identify a single-supplier item with the highest purchase amount. In response, you engage with additional vendors to diversify product supply and reduce over-reliance on a specific vendor. 

As a purchaser, you want to analyze vendor behaviors to manage effective supplier relationships. Using the purchase discount amount over time, you might identify a vendor who is not consistently delivering discounts compared to other vendors. With this information, you are empowered to negotiate discounted purchase prices to improve profit metrics.
