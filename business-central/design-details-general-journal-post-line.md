# Design Details: General Journal Post Line

This documentation provides detailed technical insight into the concepts and principles that were used to redesign the general journal posting line feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The redesign made codeunit 12 simpler and more maintainable. The documentation starts by describing conceptual overviews of the redesign. Then it explains the technical architecture to show the changes that result from the redesign.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this section applies to the redesign in an earlier version of the product, Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 R2.
