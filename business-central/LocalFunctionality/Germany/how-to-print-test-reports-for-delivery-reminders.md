# Print test reports for delivery reminders in the German version

After creating delivery reminders and making any changes in the German version, you can either print the test reports or issue the delivery reminders.

## Print test reports before issuing delivery reminders  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Delivery Reminder List** page, choose the **Delivery Reminder - Test** action.  
1. On the **Delivery Reminder - Test** page, set a filter if you want to print only selected delivery reminders.
