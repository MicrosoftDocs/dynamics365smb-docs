# General Business Functionality
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance and sales. For more information, see [Business Functionality](across-business-functionality.md).

To support those business area-specific tasks, you can use a variety of general business functionality, such as defining extended text for document lines and organizing connecting business tasks in workflows.

The following table lists these general business areas with links to topics that describe them.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
|View ongoing, posted, or archived documents that are related to sales and purchase order lines.|[Track Document Lines](across-how-to-track-document-lines.md)|
| Communicate the contents of business documents quickly to your business partners, such as the payment information on sales documents to customers. |[Sending Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md) |
| Set up standard text codes so you can extend standard text by adding extra lines, and set up conditions for use of the extra lines. |[Defining Extended Text](ui-how-define-ext-text.md) |
|Create tasks to remind you of work to be done. You can create tasks for yourself, but you can also assign tasks to others or be assigned a task by someone else in your organization.|[Defining User Tasks](across-user-tasks.md)|
|Let the system help you complete tasks quicker and more correctly by prefilling fields or complete lines with data that you would otherwise have to calculate and enter yourself.|[Letting Business Central Suggest Values](ui-let-system-suggest-values.md)|
|Record external documents in Financials, including their file attachments, and then manually create the related documents or automatically convert the files to electronic documents.|[Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md)|
|Set up and use workflows that connect tasks performed by different users or by the system, such as automatic posting. Requesting and granting approval to create or post documents are typical workflow steps.|[Workflow](across-workflow.md)|
