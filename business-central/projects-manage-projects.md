# Project Management

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can perform common project management tasks, such as configuring a project and scheduling a resource, as well as providing the information needed to manage budgets and monitor progress. You can track machine and employee hours on the project by using time sheets. As a project manager, you have a good overview, not only of individual projects, but also of the allocation of employees, machinery and other resources being used in all projects.

Before you can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to manage projects, you must set up resources, time sheets, and projects. For more information, see [Setting Up Project Management](projects-setup-projects.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

| Create a time sheet with integrated project task and planning lines and post time sheet lines to a project journal. |[Use time sheets for projects](projects-how-use-time-sheets.md) |
| Budget for resources to be used in projects and compare actual item and resource usage to budgeted usage to improve the quality and cost efficiency of future projects. |[Manage Project Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md) |

| Post the consumption of materials, resources, and other expenses of project work in process (WIP) to monitor its financial value and to maintain correct financial statements even though you post project expenses before invoicing the project. |[Monitor Project Progress and Performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md) |
| Record project costs for resource usage, materials, and project-related purchases on an on-going basis and invoice the customer, either when the project is finished or according to an invoicing schedule. |[Invoice Project](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md) |

## Get started with projects

Project management is complicated enough in itself, and learning how to create projects and managing work in process in a new tool can be another complication. To help you get started with project management in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can see [a video about creating projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw) on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] YouTube channel.
