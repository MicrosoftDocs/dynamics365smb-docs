# Submit alerts about country/region-specific regulatory features

We invite you to use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to submit regulatory alerts through the Dynamics regulatory alert submission service.  

## To submit a regulatory alert in LCS

1. Go to [Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com) and sign in.  

    You are presented with the projects you have access to.

2. Select the **Regulatory Alerts - Worldwide** project.

    This opens the project and shows various things related to this project.

3. Select the **Alert service** on the right side in the **More tools** section.

    You get a list of alerts with the headline **Dynamics Regulatory Alert Submission**.

4. You can add a new alert by clicking the plus sign **(+)** sign at the top of the list.

    This presents you with a 4-step guide to create the alert. The guide has the following steps:
    - Search for existing items.

        Search for any information you think is relevant for the alert you're going to create. If you don't find any relevant search results you can select the **Submit regulatory alert** button at the bottom of the page to proceed with the alert submission.
    - Attach business processes.

        This part isn't relevant for Dynamics 365 Business Central. Choose **Skip** to proceed to the next step.
    - Describe the alert.

        Enter information about the alert in the appropriate fields. A red asterisk (\*) in the guide indicates the required fields.

You can add up to three files that have a size of 5 MB each. To delete the attached files, select **Remove** under the title of the file. Attachments must be publicly available materials. They can't be propriety or customer-specific/partner-specific.|

        Select **Submit** to save and submit the alert.

        If you don't have all of the required information, or if you're not yet ready to submit the alert, you can save a partially completed alert.
