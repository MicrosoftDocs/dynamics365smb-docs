# User Personalization
You can change how certain UI elements are displayed in your version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] to best serve your needs.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Personalizations apply to your user account only. Other users do not see them.

## To add or remove a column
On lists and document lines, not all available column information is displayed by default. You can add or remove columns with the **Choose Columns** function.

1. Open the window with a list or document lines that you want to add or remove columns on.
2. Choose any column heading, access the drop-down menu, and then choose the **Choose Columns** action.
3. In the **Choose Columns** window, select or clear the **Visible** check box for the columns that you want to add or remove.
4. Choose the **OK** button.
