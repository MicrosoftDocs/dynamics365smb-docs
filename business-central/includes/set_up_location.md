## Setting Up the Location

The setup of the **Location Card** page defines the company's warehouse flows. Use the Locations card to set up a location with the code name *SOUTH*.

### To set up the location SOUTH

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a location card named *SOUTH*.  
3. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select both the **Require Pick** and **Bin Mandatory** fields.
4. Next, you must add posting setup in the **Inventory Posting Setup** page for location *SOUTH* with **Inventory Posting Group Code** *RESALE*. For more information see [Set Up Locations](../inventory-how-setup-locations.md).
