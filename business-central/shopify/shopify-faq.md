# FAQ for Technical Details

This article answers frequently asked questions about the Shopify connector.

## What is Shopify? 

Shopify is a subscription-based software that allows anyone to set up an online store and sell their products. The Shopify platform offers online retailers a suite of services including payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement tools. 

## What is the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Shopify connector? 

With the Shopify connector, businesses can link their Shopify store (or stores) with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to maximize business productivity. Using the Shopify connector, they can manage and view insights from their business and their Shopify online store as one unit. 

## Why did Microsoft and Shopify form this partnership? 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_long.md)] is teaming up with Shopify to help our customers create a better shopping experience. While Shopify provides merchants with an easy-to-use commerce solution, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] offers comprehensive business management across finance, sales, service, and operations teams within a single application. Seamless connection between the two systems synchronizes orders, stock, and customer information so merchants can fulfill orders faster and better serve customers.

## What Microsoft products is the Shopify connector available for?

This feature is available only for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, starting with version 20.1. It isn't available for on-premises deployments. The app with the connector is pre-installed for new environments. Organizations with existing environments can download and install the app from AppSource. The organization must have both a Business Central license and a Shopify license to use the connector. Learn more about supported countries, languages, and editions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] at [Shopify Connector on the AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196238).

The Shopify connector doesn't work for [Embed App](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview), where the client URL has the format: `https://[application name].bc.dynamics.com`. 

## What support is offered for the Shopify connector?

The Shopify connector is covered by the current support model. Learn more at [Technical Support](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration//manage-technical-support) (in English only). 

Get help with Shopify by starting with [General Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/) or [24/7 Support for your store as a Shopify merchant](https://help.shopify.com/questions#/).

## Is the Shopify connector extensible?

Currently, this app is non-extensible with plans to make it extensible at some point (as yet undetermined) in the future.

## Is the Shopify connector open for contribution

Yes, this extension is open for contribution by the community. You can find the [source code](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/main/Apps/W1/Shopify) in the Microsoft AL application add-ons repository.
