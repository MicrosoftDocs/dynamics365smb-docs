# Use online maps to find locations and directions

You can get a map from your online map service that shows the address and location of a customer or vendor, or generate route directions to them. The **Online Map** feature can be accessed on the following cards in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* Location card
* Customer card
* Vendor card
* Resource card
* Project card
* Bank account card
* Contact card
* Employee card
* Ship-to address

> [!NOTE]
> If there's no code in the **Country/Region Code** field, the online map will not be able to find directions.

## Find a location in an online map

1. Open one of the cards listed above.
2. Choose the **Online Map** or **Show on Map** action.
3. Choose the **This address** field, then choose **OK**.
4. The configured online map opens with the address location defined on the card.

## Get route directions from your location

1. Open one of the cards listed above.
2. Choose the **Online Map** or **Show on Map** action.
3. Choose the **Directions from my location** field, then choose **OK**.
4. The configured online map opens with route directions to the location defined on the card.

> [!NOTE]
> The online map opens in the default browser or app, which may request access to the device's location data.
