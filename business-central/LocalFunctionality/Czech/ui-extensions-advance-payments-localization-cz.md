# Advance Payments Localization for Czech (Extension)

Use the **Advance Payments** extension in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to create invoices and make payments before goods or services are delivered. The Advance Payments solution helps you meet regulatory requirements for registering and posting advanced payments (prepayments), including VAT requirements in the Czech Republic.

Advance Payment features let you receive advance invoices from suppliers, issue advance invoices to customers, make advance payments that include payments subject to VAT, and drawdown advance payments on receipts. The features also provide tax documents required by legislation, such as outputs for financial statements and VAT reports. Some highlights that the extension provides are:

- Sales and purchase advances
- Advances you receive and issue
- Tax documents and tax credit notes for Advance Payments received or issued

## Main functions of the module

- Create sales or purchase advance invoices according to settings on the **Advance Letter Templates** page.
- Create advances from sales orders based on a percentage or amount.
- Propose advances on a payment order and, on the other side, payment of advances by the bank.
- Connect to the **Cash Desk** module for the ability to pay advances in cash.
- Issue and print advance VAT documents for advance payments automatically or manually.
- Manage the use of paid advances by the final invoice.
- Close unused advances, including a VAT settlement.
- Work with a foreign currency, including exchange rate differences between the advance payment and invoice.
- Unassign payments to advance invoices or use more linking.
- Unlink final invoices from advance payments, or create more linking.
- Use a responsibility center for advance documents to display only documents relevant to a specific user.
- Use reports for recapitulation of payments and drawdown of advances, and reports for recapitulation of VAT on advances.
