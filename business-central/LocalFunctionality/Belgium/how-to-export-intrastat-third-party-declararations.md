# Export intrastat third-party declarations in the Belgian version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In Belgium, you must have a third-party declarant fill out the Intrastat declaration. The third-party declarant must be an external person or company.  

## To export the third-party declaration

Before you export the file, it's a good idea to preview the report. For more information, see [Print the Intrastat Form Report](how-to-print-the-intrastat-form-report.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Create File** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Nihil declaration**|Select if you don't have any trade transactions with European Union (EU) countries/regions and want to send an empty declaration.|  
    |**Counter party info**|Check this field to include counter party information in the Intrastat file (new requirement from 2019). The counter party information added to the file is taken from the **Country/Region of Origin Code** and **Partner ID** fields from the Intrastat Journal.|  
    |**Enterprise No./VAT Reg. No.**|Enter the enterprise or VAT registration number.|  

4. Choose the **OK** button.  

Next, submit the declaration to the OneGate portal.
