# Calculate Goods and Services Tax on Prepayments
When a partial payment or prepayment is made, you must calculate Goods and Services Tax (GST) for that partial payment or prepayment based on the total invoice amount, instead of on a partial amount. If you account for GST on a noncash basis, you must report and pay GST on payments during the period in which you receive partial payment or issue a tax invoice for payment.  

## To calculate GST on prepayments  

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the **Full GST on Prepayment** check box to calculate GST for the total invoice amount when a prepayment invoice is posted.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.
