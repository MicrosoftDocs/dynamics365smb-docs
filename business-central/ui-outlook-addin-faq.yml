      - question: |
          How do I change the environment my add-in is pointing to?  
        answer: |
          The environment URL is configured in the add-in when the add-in is installed (specifically, in the add-in's manifest file). If you want the add-in to point to a different environment, open the desired Business Central environment and deploy the add-in again, for example, by running the **Get the Outlook Add-in** assisted setup. This action  will redeploy the add-in with updated environment URLs. 

          > [!NOTE]
          > It might take some time before the change takes effect.

      - question: |
          Can I customize the add-in to connect to multiple environments?
        answer: |
          Yes. As an administrator, developer, or partner, you can modify and build your own add-in manifests. One way is to download the Contact Insights manifest from each environment that the users want to connect to. Then, modify the `<Id>` and `<DisplayName>` tags to allow multiple versions of the add-in to be installed. These modifications will let the user have multiple Business Central add-ins installed, each pointing to their own environment.

      - question: |
          Outlook add-in tells me the page is not supported. Why?
        answer: |
          Some features in Business Central require significant workspace to provide a great experience and aren't available when using the Outlook add-in pane. For example, any step-by-step wizard page isn't available in the pane. To overcome this, you can pop out the page in the add-in using the "Pop out" action. The popout window can be stretched to any size including expanding to fill your screen.

      - question: |
          Does the Outlook add-in work on a shared mailbox?
        answer: |
          No, not currently.
