# Search for a Record in Your Data

When you want to find a particular record or value, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to look for it. To learn more about searching in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Finding Pages and Information with Tell Me](ui-search.md).

## How search works

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Getting started

You can speed up results by choosing the fields on the tables that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.
