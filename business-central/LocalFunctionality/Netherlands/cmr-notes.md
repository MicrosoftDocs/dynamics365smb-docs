# CMR Notes
A CMR note is a bill of lading or an international consignment note defined under the 1956 United Nations Convention for the Contract of the International Carriage of Goods by Road. This is also known as the CMR Convention.  

 Claims with complete CMR note information are easily processed.  

## CMR Notes  
Countries that follow the CMR Convention adhere to a standard form for CMR notes. The type of CMR note used depends on the type of transaction. There are three types:  

- **CMR - Sales Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for sales shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Purchase Return Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for purchase return shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.       

- **CMR - Transfer Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for transfer shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the location from which the items are shipped, the location to which the items are shipped, and information regarding the shipping agent, along with data about the shipped items.

> [!NOTE]  
>  CMR notes are formatted to print on preprinted CMR forms.  

The following details the standard life cycle of a CMR note:  

- The warehouse manager prints the CMR notes for the shipments that need to be sent.  
- The shipments are then packed and handed to the truck driver, along with the CMR notes.  
- The driver ensures that each shipment has a CMR note.  
- When goods are delivered to the customers, the driver ensures that the customers sign the CMR notes.  
- The signed CMR notes are then given to the respective internal Accounts Receivable departments.  
- The Accounts Payable administrators receive the signed CMR notes, along with the invoice for freight forwarding services from the freight forwarder.
