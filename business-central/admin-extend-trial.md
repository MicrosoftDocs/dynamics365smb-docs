# Need More Time to Decide Whether to Subscribe?
It's important to make the right decision when choosing a business application, and we know that it can take time to explore all of the corners in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. If you need more time to finish your evaluation, you can extend the trial period yourself for another 30 days. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching, we will display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the **Extend Trial Period** guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose **Extend Trial** in the guide.

Extending the trial period yourself is a one time-thing though. You cannot extend it twice, at least not yourself. If you have already extended the period, your Microsoft partner can extend it for you again. That's also a one-time thing. If you are not already working with a partner, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.md#findpartner).  

## To extend your trial period

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)].

    Sign in with the email account that you used when you signed up for the trial.  

    If you signed up with an email account from a [30-day trial of Office 365](/microsoft-365/commerce/sign-up-for-office-365-trial), then you must first extend your Office 365 trial, or buy a Office 365 subscription. For more information, see [Extend your trial for Office 365 for business](/microsoft-365/commerce/extend-your-trial).
2. In the notification at the top of the workspace, choose **Extend Trial**.

    If you dismissed the notification, you must sign out and then sign in again.

If your organization has established a reseller relationship with a partner, they can sign in to your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] as a delegated administrator and run the same **Extend Trial Period** guide. They can also contact Microsoft Support to extend the trial a third time. For more information, see [Extending trials (as an administrator)](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration#extending-trials).  

## What happens if my trial period is expired?

If your first 30-day trial period is expired, you can extend it yourself as described above, and things will be business as usual. Just sign in to the demonstration company and start the **Extend Trial Period** guide from the notification.  

If you have created your own company, sign out and then sign in again with the credentials for that company. If your extended trial period is expired, you can [subscribe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828659) to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] within 90 days and continue working in the company you created. After 90 days, we will delete your company and data.
