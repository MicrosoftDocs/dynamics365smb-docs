# Print VAT summary information on documents in the Icelandic version

If VAT is calculated, VAT summary information is typically printed on sales and purchase documents. However, in Iceland, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't print VAT summary information if only one VAT sales code is used in the document. You can modify this behavior by using the **Always Show VAT Summary** option.  

The following procedure describes how to display VAT summary information on a sales invoice document. The same steps also apply to sales order confirmations, sales quotes, sales credit memos, blanket sales orders, purchase orders, purchase invoices, and purchase credit memos.  

## Show VAT summary information  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the list, select the relevant document, and then choose the **Print** action.  
1. To display VAT information in the report, select the **Always Show VAT Summary** check box.
