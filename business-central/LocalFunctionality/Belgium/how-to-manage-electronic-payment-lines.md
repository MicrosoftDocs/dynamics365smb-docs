# Manage Electronic Payment Lines
You can have [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] suggest payments automatically and then you can add more payments manually. You can also edit or delete suggested payments. You must correct all errors before you can post the electronic payment lines. The following procedure describes how to manually add or edit payment journal lines, but you can also delete payment journal lines on the **Payment Journal** page.  

## To manage a payment journal line  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
3.  Select a journal line and enter the information as needed.  

     - or -  

    To delete the selected line, choose the **Delete** action.  

4.  Choose the **OK** button.
