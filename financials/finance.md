# Finance
[!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] includes a standard configuration of most financial processes, but you can change the configuration to suit your business. For more information, see [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md].

The default configuration includes a chart of accounts and standard posting groups that make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
