# Vendor Deferrals (Power BI Report)

The **Vendor Deferrals** report provides a comprehensive overview of expenses that have been invoiced by vendors but not yet recognized. It allows users to track deferral balances and recognition schedules, helping you understand the timing of future expenses and ensure accurate financial reporting of your subscription-based assets.

## Use the report

The report is meant for financial managers and accountants.

Financial managers can use this report to gain visibility into the company’s future expense recognition. By analyzing the bar chart, which visualizes the balance between Deferred and Released (recognized) expenses over time, you can accurately forecast how and when prepaid costs will impact your income statement. This helps in aligning budget expectations with actual financial performance and managing your outgoing commitments.

Accountants can use the report to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the vendor deferral accounts. The detailed table provides a breakdown of released and deferred amounts by year and month, making it easy to perform period-end reconciliations of prepaid expenses.

Specifically, you can use this report to verify that all vendor-side deferred expenses are being released correctly. By looking at previous months, you can quickly identify if any "open" deferred expenses remain in the past that should have already been recognized. This ensures that your financial statements are complete and that no expenses are erroneously held on the balance sheet beyond the period the service was received.
