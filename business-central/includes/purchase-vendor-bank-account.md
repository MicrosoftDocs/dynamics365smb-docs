> [!TIP]
> Some fields are hidden until you choose the **Show more** action, typically because they are used rarely. Others must be added through personalization. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](../ui-personalization-user.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Some fields on the vendor bank account contain sensitive business data, such as the **Bank Branch No.**, **Bank Account No.**, **SWIFT Code**, and **IBAN Code**. For more information on how to monitor and be notified when someone changes a value in those fields, see [Monitor Sensitive Fields](../across-log-changes.md#monitor-sensitive-fields).
