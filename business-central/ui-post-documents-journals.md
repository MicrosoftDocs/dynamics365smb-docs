# Posting Documents and Journals
Posting represents the accounting action of recording business transactions in the various company ledgers.

Practically every document and journal in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] offers a **Posting** group from which you can choose between different posting actions, such as **Post**, **Preview Posting**, **Post and Send**, **Post and Email**.
