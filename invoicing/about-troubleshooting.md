# Troubleshooting [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)]
Read this section for tips and troubleshooting info on [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)].

## How do I save my changes?
You might have noticed that there isn't a Save button in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]. This is because everything is saved when you enter data, so that your accountant has full traceability into your transactions. Just close the page and continue working.  

## How do I close a window?
When you open an invoice, an estimate, or other pages in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], there's an X in the top right corner. Choose the X to close the window. For the mobile app, it depends on your mobile device, but in many cases, you can use the Back button on your mobile device to return to the Home screen.  

## Where do I change the logo?
You can do that in the Settings for [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]. The picture that you upload in Settings is then printed on your invoices. For more information, see [Set up your business information](set-up-business-profile.md).  

## How can I change the email account that sends the invoices?
You can do that in the Settings for [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]. By default, invoices are sent from your Office 365 email address, but you can change that to any email account, including your personal email address. For more information, see [Set up your business information](set-up-business-profile.md).  

## Why can't I see the number on my invoice?
The number is generated when you send the invoice. Until then, it does not have a number. You can see the expected next number in the **Settings** page.  

## Can I change the design of my invoice?
Not yet. We're working on this feature and will update our content as soon as it's available.  

## How can I delete an invoice?
If you've sent an invoice to a customer, you can cancel the invoice, but you can't delete it. When you delete an invoice, you customer gets a cancellation email and your accountant will be able to see that the invoice was cancelled. To cancel an invoice, follow these steps:
- From the Invoices list, open the invoice you want to cancel.  
- Choose Cancel.  
- Choose whether to send a cancellation email and then close the invoice.  

## Can I get training in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]?
Not yet.  

## Who has access to [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]?
To get access to [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], you must have an [Office 365 Business Premium subscription](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-business-premium).  

However, small businesses often deal with sensitive customer information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, or health records. In the tech world, this is called personally identifiable information, or PII for short. It’s the job of the business owner to protect this information. One way you can protect PII is to control which of your employees has access. If you choose not to give access to [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] to your employees, they can't use it. Any user in your business who is a global admin already has access to [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)].  

Go to Office 365 Admin center > Settings > Services & add-ins > Business apps, and then add employees to [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)].  

## Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes, you can remove [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] from your Office 365 subscription. But you can also choose to simply not use [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)].  

## Why does it say Dynamics 365 at the top of the page?
You have access to [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] through your Office 365 subscription, but the app is part of the Dynamics 365 family. More information about this will be announced later.  

## Why can't I use my Dynamics 365 company in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]?
If you've signed up for a trial of Dynamics 365 Business Central, but you haven't accessed your trial since April 1, 2017, then you need to log into Dynamics 365 and recreate the company before you can use it in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)].
