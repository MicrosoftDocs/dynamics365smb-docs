# Open a New Fiscal Year in the French Version

Before you can post in a fiscal year, you must open the fiscal year and define its accounting periods.  

## To open a new fiscal year  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  Choose the **Create Year** action.  
3.  On the **Options** FastTab, define the structure of the fiscal year. The fiscal year is usually 12 periods of one month each, but you can also divide it in other ways.  
4.  Fill in the fields.  
5.  Choose the **OK** button.  

The accounting periods are created, and the result is shown. The **Starting Date** field and the **Name** field are filled in with the name of the month from the starting date.  

After the last period in the fiscal year, an accounting period is inserted with the **New Fiscal Year** field selected.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In concordance with French law no more than two open fiscal years are allowed.
