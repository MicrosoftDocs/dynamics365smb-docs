# Define User Tasks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can create tasks to remind you of work to be done. You can create tasks for yourself, but you can also assign tasks to others or be assigned a task by someone else in your organization.  

## Managing User Tasks

The **User Tasks** page shows all tasks, and you can easily create and assign new tasks. When you create a task, you can specify the start date and due date, and you can add a link to the page or report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] where the user must do the work.  

For example, you can create a task for yourself or a coworker to view all posted sales invoices. In that case, you link the task to page 143, **Posted Sales Invoices**. In the following screenshot, someone is creating a task for MeganB to review the posted sales invoices.

> [!TIP]  
> Use the look-up in the **Page** field and then use the **Search** field to find the page that you want.  
>
> You can link to any page, but you cannot link to individual entries, so make the description as explicit as possible, such as writing "Please take a look at customer no. 10000 and make sure they don't have overdue payments.".

### Picking Up User Tasks

In the Business Manager, Bookkeeper, and Accountant Role Centers, a tile shows pending tasks that are assigned to that user. To pick up a task, simply choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the page where you can do the work.  

When you have completed a task, simply mark it as completed.  

### Deleting User Tasks

If you want to bulk delete all or some user tasks, you can use the **Delete User Tasks** report. In the request page, you can set filters to determine which tasks must be deleted.
