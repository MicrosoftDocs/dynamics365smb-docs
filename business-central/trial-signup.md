# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a free trial. There are two ways to access the trial version, depending on your location. If you are in a country where Microsoft offers official localization, you can follow one path. If you are in a country where localization is handled by partners, you'll need to follow a different path. Explore the different types of localization [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## Start the trial in Microsoft-based localizations 

You can find your free [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial on the **[Dynamics 365 Business Central product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)** page. You just need to follow the steps and you'll get trial localized version tailored for your location. If you want eventually to try different localization, you can do it in the sandbox. 

<!--## To sign up for the trial-->

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations  

In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, obtaining a localized version by default isn't possible due to localization being managed by partners. Consequently, Microsoft can only provide the standard base app, typically without localization or translation. To avoid confusion not offering all local requirements and the language, we have different path of getting trial version, so you can have full local experience.  

You can get your trial version following these steps:

1. You must run "Find your partner" on [Microsoft web site](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) or ask local Microsoft office for advice. 
2. Microsoft can help you find a partner for you or you might have already found a partner based on your experience. 
3. You might offer your partner for the trial version and then partner goes to CSP.  
   1. Finds or adds customer tenant.   
   2. Assigns the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Trial SKU in CSP. 
   3. Assigns the localization and translation, and eventually assigns translated demo data to the created tenant. 
   4. Sends customer link to the environment.   
   5. The test trial environment will be accessible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't oversee how partners set up the trial environment or what specific elements are included. While Microsoft offers recommendations, partners have the flexibility to implement them in their own way. Using a trial version from one partner doesn't obligate you to purchase a license from them, and you can always choose to switch partners at any time.  

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).
