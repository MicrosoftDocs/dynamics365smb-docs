# How to: Transfer Simulation Entries
When you have created and posted simulation entries to the general ledger, you can transfer the simulation entries into real accounting entries.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You transfer simulated entries to the general ledger but create new general journal entries that must be posted manually, and delete the original simulation entries.  
  
### To transfer simulation entries  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **Simulation Registers**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  Select the simulation register that you want to transfer, and then, on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Transfer**.  
  
3.  Select the general journal template and general journal batch that you want to transfer the entries to, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
4.  In the window that appears, choose the **Yes**  button to confirm the deletion of the simulation entries.  
  
5.  Open the relevant general journal and post the newly created journal entries.
