# Managing contacts

Employees in your company regularly meet prospective business relations that might develop into formal relationships. All such external contacts and their detailed information should be recorded in the system so that communication is more successful and so they can easily be converted to formal customer, vendor, or bank relationships.

Use the **Contacts** list to manage your contacts. From there, you can create opportunities and manage other interactions with individual contacts. You can also see statistics about a contact, and you can access a range of reports. For information about how to find the right contact in the list, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md) .  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.
