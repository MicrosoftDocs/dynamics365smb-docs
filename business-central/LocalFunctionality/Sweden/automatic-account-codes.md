# Automatic Account Codes
You can use customized posting groups to automate recurring transactions in journals, sales documents, or purchase documents. These posting groups can be used throughout [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] to trigger automatic postings and allocations across different accounts or dimensions.  

Automatic account codes can be used to automate postings related to payroll overhead. For example, when posting total salary expenses at the end of the month, you can use automatic account codes to assign a percentage of the total salary to automatically post as overhead expenses.  

You can also use automatic account codes to trigger cost or revenue allocations across different dimensions. For example, you can set up an automatic account group to divide total expenses across three departments when posting an invoice.
