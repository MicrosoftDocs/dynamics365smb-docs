# Need More Time to Decide Whether to Subscribe?
It's important to make the right decision when choosing a business application, and we know that it can take time to explore all of the corners in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. If you need more time to finish your evaluation you can extend the trial period yourself for another 30 days. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching we will display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the **Extend Trial Period** guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose **Extend Trial** in the guide.

Extending the trial period yourself is a one time-thing though. You cannot extend it twice, at least not yourself. If you have already extended the period, your Microsoft partner can extend it for you again. That's also a one-time thing. If you are not already working with a partner, the following link will help you find one: [Contact a partner](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038439).

## What happens if my trial period is expired?
If your first 30-day trial period is expired, you can extend it yourself and things will be business as usual. Just sign in to the demonstration company and start the **Extend Trial Period** guide from the notification. If you have created your own company, sign out and then sign in again with the credentials for that company. If your extended trial period is expired, you can [subscribe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828659) to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] within 90 days and continue working in the company you created. After 90 days we will delete your company and data. 

## To extend your trial period
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].
2. In the notification at the top of the workspace, choose **Extend Trial**.
