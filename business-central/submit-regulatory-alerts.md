# Submit Alerts about Country/Region-Specific Regulatory Features

We invite you to use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to submit regulatory alerts through the Dynamics regulatory alert submission service.  

## To submit a regulatory alert in LCS

1. Go to https://lcs.dynamics.com and log in  

    You will be presented with the projects you have access to

2. Select the **Regulatory Alerts - Worldwide** project

    This will open the project and show a variety of things related to this project

3. Select the **Alert service** on the right side in the **More tools** section

    You will see a list of alerts with the headline **Dynamics Regulatory Alert Submission**

4. You can add a new alert by clicking the plus sign **(+)** sign at the top of the list

    This will present you with a 4-step guide to create the alert. The guide has the following steps:
    - Search for existing items

        Search for any information you think is relevant for the alert you are going to create. If you do not find any relevant search results you can select the **Submit regulatory alert** button at the bottom of the page to proceed with the alert submission.
