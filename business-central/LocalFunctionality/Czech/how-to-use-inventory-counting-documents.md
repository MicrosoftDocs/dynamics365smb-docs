# Inventory counting documents in the Czech version

At the end of the period, users perform physical inventory counting to reconcile the actual (physical) value of inventory with the one registered in the system. At the end of the counting process, the accounting department needs to archive a final inventory counting document containing posted values with names of company officials who, under liability, confirm with their signature that the quantities and amounts stated in the document are the ones physically present in the company's inventory locations.

For the reasons above, this feature provides the following reports:

- Phys. Inventory List Report is used to print documents from Phys. Inventory Journals (existing report improved).
- Phys. Invt. Counting Document Report is used to print posted Phys. Inventory operations.
