# Budgets
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides budget functions so that you can plan and work with budgets.  
  
## Budget Functions  
 You use budget functions to:  
  
-   Create budgets.  
  
-   Export and import budgets.  
  
### Creating Budgets  
 You can create budgets by period so the total budget amounts are split across periods. You can also create budgets from history so the budget is based on actual historical entries for an account. Creating budgets from history lets you adjust the amount from the previous period by a certain percentage to use in the new budget.  
  
### Exporting and Importing Budgets  
 You can export budgets to and import budgets from:  
  
-   Microsoft Excel (.xls) workbooks.  
  
-   Comma–delimited (.csv) files.
