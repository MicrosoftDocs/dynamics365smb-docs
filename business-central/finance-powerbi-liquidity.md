# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

## How to use the report

The target audience for the *Liquidity* report is
- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

As an executive, you would use the Liquidity report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity you could asses the Current Ratio which compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability. 

For a more conservative assessment you could then analyze the Quick Ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on on cash and assets that can be quickly converted to cash such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the Cash Ratio which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This is the most conservative perspective and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.
