# Capacity Variance (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Capacity Variance** report gives an overview of the variance between expected and actual capacity costs on a monthly basis. This report helps you identify areas where costs are overrunning. You can optimize production processes, reduce costs, and improve overall performance.

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to track and manage capacity costs for production operations. By analyzing the variance between expected and actual capacity costs on a monthly basis, you can find areas where costs are overrunning and take corrective action.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor the performance of production lines and ensure they operate within budget. By tracking the actual capacity costs against the expected costs, you can quickly uncover deviations. For example, the report might show that the cost of raw materials increased significantly. You can investigate whether the issue is due to supplier pricing or production inefficiencies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Capacity Variance* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Capacity Cost Amt. Deviation %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-cost-amt-deviation)
- [Expected Capacity Cost Amount](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-cost-amount)
- [Capacity Cost Amt. (Actual)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-cost-amt-actual)
- [Capacity Cost Amt. Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-cost-amt-variance)
