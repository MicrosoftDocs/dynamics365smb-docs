# How to: Create Report 347
All companies must provide an annual declaration, **Report 347**, to the tax authorities providing the sales and purchase transactions from the previous fiscal period.  
  
 The Report 347 declaration is generated in a format that is approved by the tax authorities for upload to their Virtual Office website or submission on CD-ROM.  
  
 Before you create the Report 347 declaration, you can run a report to identify payments in cash that have not been applied to a document.  
  
### To identify unapplied payments in cash  
  
1.  In the **Search** box, enter **347**, and then choose the link for the **347 Declaration** area.  
  
2.  Under **Reports and Analysis**, choose **Unapplied Payments in Cash**.  
  
3.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields. For more information, see Not Fully Applied Cash Pmts..

3.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
 When you send the Report 347 declaration, you must include 347 declaration labels. The labels are required as part of the package for the tax authorities.
