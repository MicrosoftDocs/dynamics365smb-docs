# Import Payroll Transactions
You can import payroll transactions into a general journal from the leading Norwegian payroll solution, Huldt & Lillevik Lønn - Visma. You can then use the general journal to post the imported payroll transactions to general ledger accounts or bank accounts. To import payroll transactions, you must first set up payroll integration.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To import payroll transactions, your [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../../includes/prodshort.md)] must include the **Payroll Data Definitions (NO)** extension. If you are not sure if you have this extension, please talk to your administrator.  

## To import payroll transactions  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the journal to use, and then use the **Import Payroll File** action to import the data file from the payroll service provider.  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.
