# Manage Marketplace apps
 
From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can discover, view, sort, and filter available Marketplace apps that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

On the **Microsoft Marketplace Apps** page, you can filter available Marketplace apps by name, publisher name, install state, popularity, average rating, number of ratings, and last modified date. You can also select a given app and see the details for that specific app.

To locate the page, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], [!INCLUDE[open-search](includes/open-search-lowercase.md)], enter **Microsoft Marketplace Apps**, and then choose the related link.

On the page, you find the following actions:

- **View Marketplace** to open the online Marketplace marketplace in a new browser window. 
- **View in Marketplace** to open and view a selected app in the online Marketplace Marketplace. 
- **Refresh list from Microsoft Marketplace** to force a refresh of the list of all apps to Marketplace marketplace content—for example, if you're looking for a newly submitted Marketplace app.

As with other list pages, you get support for Analysis Mode, for example, so that you can group apps by publisher. Use Copilot to design an **Analysis Mode** view for you.
