# Get ready for doing business

Congratulations, you have your first company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To help you get ready for doing business, you can visit the **Assisted Setup** page where you can launch assisted setup guides, videos, or help articles for selected setup tasks. To access the page, choose [this link](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1801).  

Alternatively, choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then the **Assisted Setup** action.

You can also find the list of assisted setup guides if you [!INCLUDE[open-search](includes/open-search-lowercase.md)], enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

## Get started

When you sign in for the first time or launch a new company, the **Get Started** checklist takes you through the steps to make you ready for business. The steps vary depending on your country/region and any industry-specific functionality that you added to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Starting with 2021 release wave 2, when you first sign in to the CRONUS demonstration company, your home page is optimized for your first experiences. If you prefer to see more links to more pages, just switch to the Business Manager role. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

After you migrate data, such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system, you're ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if other assisted setup guides on the list can help you.

If an area isn't covered by an assisted setup, choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then the **Advanced Settings** action. In **Advanced Settings**, the **Manual Setup** section provides access to setup pages where you can fill in setup fields for all areas manually. For more information, see also [Setting Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The list of assisted setup guides, extensions, and services that are available differ depending on the user experience you choose for your company. The **Essential** experience gives access to fewer than the **Premium** experience does.
>
> The first time you sign in, you use the **Essential** experience. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

After you run an assisted setup guide, it's marked as **Completed**.  

## Teaching tips and tours

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes in-product tours and teaching tips that can help you get started. In the current version, there are tours for the steps in the **Get started** list and some of the most commonly used pages in the demonstration company, such as the **Sales Invoice** card page.  

Teaching tips are short messages that inform, remind, or teach you about important and new capabilities that launch automatically when you open a page. For example, to see the teaching tip for the **Sales Invoice** card, choose the link in the top left corner of the page where it says *Sales Invoice*. This launches a callout with a short description of the page and what you can do there. If a tour exists for the page, a link invites you to take the tour. The *Learn more* link takes you to the product Help for the page.

## Role-specific home pages

Depending on your role, the home page provides an overview of the business. The navigation bar gives you easy access to customers, vendors, items, and so on. The **Activities** tiles show current data and provide easy access to the selected document.

The **Key Performance Indicators** can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of **Favorite Customers** on the home page for accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to.

Use the arrows to collapse a part of the page and make more room to show specific data. At the top of the home page you'll find all of the actions that you can use in the current content. You can collapse this area too. To expand it again, select or tap in the collapsed area.

> [!TIP]  
> You can get back to the home page by selecting the company name in the upper left corner.

## Company information

Under **Company Settings**, you can view and edit setup information about the current company. Much of this information was prefilled if you completed the **Set Up Company** assisted setup when you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you want to change the company logo, contact information, bank settings, or tax information, you can do it from this page.  

## Adding users and permissions

When users are created in Microsoft 365, you can import them to the **Users** page by using the **Get Updates from Office 365** action. You can then assign permissions to users and to organize them in user groups. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).
