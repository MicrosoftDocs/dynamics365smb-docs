# Bank Management
In ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)]-->, you can create bank directory structures to keep bank reference information in one location, create budget classifications, add bank account details to specific general ledger accounts, and print and post required documents.  
  
## Creating Bank Directory Structures  
 You can use a bank directory structure to keep reference information about all the banks in one location. This information can be used to automatically fill in the corresponding fields in the **Bank Account Card**, **Vendor Bank Account Card**, and **Customer Bank Account Card** windows.  
  
## Creating Budget Classification Codes  
 You can use a budget classification codes catalog in bank payments that are made to the state budget, such as tax payments. These codes allow you to track the classification of budget payment types in the state budget.  
  
## Creating Bank Account Details Records  
 You can use bank account details to define dimensions and other codes that are pertinent to bank payment orders and bank statements. Records in a bank operation that have the account type information set to **G\/L Account** can have bank account details attached to the specified account. Bank account details are set up in the **Bank Account Details** window.  
  
## Printing and Posting Required Documents  
 You can prepare bank payment order documents, cash order documents, and payments in the payment journal by copying procedures from the posted bank payment order and cash order documents. Then you can create the printed documents and post them in the required format.  
  
 You can print the following required bank management documents.
