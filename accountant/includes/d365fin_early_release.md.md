> [!INCLUDE [d365acc_long_md](d365acc_long_md.md)] has been in public preview in a limited number of markets. Based on feedback from the preview, [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)] will be replaced by new functionality in [!INCLUDE [d365fin_long_md](d365fin_long_md.md)] in 2020 release wave 2. From July 1st, 2020, new users will no longer be able to sign up to [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)]. Existing users will continue to have full access until [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)] is deprecated in 2020 release wave 2.  

If you currently use [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)], we recommend that you start thinking about next steps already now. We will make it easy to take your data with you both if you choose to switch to [!INCLUDE [d365fin_md](d365fin_md.md)], or if you choose to switch to another product. We will share more information in the [Dynamics 365 release plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/) for 2020 release wave 2, which will be available in July 2020.
