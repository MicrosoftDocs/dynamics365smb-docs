# Dimensions - Detail (report)

The **Dimensions - Detail** report shows a breakdown of general ledger (G/L) entries based on dimension levels specified by the user.

You specify dimension levels by selecting an analysis view configured with dimension codes, and then creating a hierarchy of dimension groups by arranging them under one another.

You can choose to see only dimension combinations that have transactions, or a list of all combinations regardless of whether they have general ledger entries.
