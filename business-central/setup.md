# Overview of Tasks to Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes standard configurations for most business processes, but you can change the configuration to suit the needs of your organization. The [Business Central quick start](quick-start-business-central.md) articles help you take the first steps into making [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] your own. This article provides an overview of how you can configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for your organization.

For example, the chart of accounts is prefilled with posting accounts that are ready for use. You can, of course, change the chart of accounts to suit your needs. Learn more at [Finance](finance.md).

From the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) menu, you can access assisted setup guides to help you configure certain scenarios and add features to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
