## What is analysis assist?

Analysis assist is a copilot that provides assistance for working with the [data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) in Business Central. The data analysis mode enables you to organize, aggregate, and summarize data on pages and queries to make it more suitable for analyzing and extracting meaningful insights. With analysis assist, you can automatically construct the view of the data you want to analyze by expressing your needs in simple, natural language, like "show vendors by location sorted by number of purchases." Analysis assist makes it easier to work with data without the need for complex technical skills.

## What are capabilities of analysis assist?

Analysis assist converts natural language instructions into a structured design for displaying data in the analysis mode, without creating, modifying, or updating customer business data itself.

## What is the intended use of analysis assist?

Analysis assist helps create analysis tabs in the data analysis mode to present data in a manner that makes it easier for you to draw conclusions. However, it's important to note that analysis assist doesn't provide direct insights or conclusions about the data. It's a tool to help users organize and view their data. It's up to the user to extract actionable information, discover trends, and make informed decisions to drive business value.

## How was analysis assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Copilot was given numerous prompts in the supported languages that covered a broad range of instructions and styles of expressing intent. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.

- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft.](https://aka.ms/RAI)

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature.

- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810)

- We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

  You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of analysis assist? How can users minimize the impact of the analysis assist limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations:

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

   [!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]
