You must set up a code for each currency you use if you:

- Buy or sell in other currencies besides your local currency (LCY).  
- Record general ledger transactions in both LCY and an additional reporting currency.  

After setting up the codes, assign the appropriate code to each foreign currency bank account, and assign a default currency code to foreign customer and vendor accounts.

You specify the currency codes in the **Currencies** list, including extra information and settings that are necessary for each currency code.

> [!TIP]
> Create the currencies with the international ISO code as the code to simplify working with the currency in the future.
