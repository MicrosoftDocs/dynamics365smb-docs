# Trial features that connect to other Microsoft services 

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] is a comprehensive business management solution that is deeply integrated with Microsoft 365 productivity apps, Power Platform, and AI services. Your free trial of Business Central can connect to many different Microsoft services that you must first configure and enable. To get the most out of your free trial, some of these features are automatically enabled for you. Even though the connection from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is enabled, these services might not be included with your trial and might need to be purchased separately unless you have them already. 

The following table indicates the connections to Microsoft services that are automatically enabled for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trials:

> - You might affect services that aren't trials. If your organization uses these services in production and aren't being evaluated together with Business Central, other users of these services who aren't participating in this trial of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might be affected.
> - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might also connect to Microsoft services or third-party services depending on the customizations and extensions that you or your administrator installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial.
