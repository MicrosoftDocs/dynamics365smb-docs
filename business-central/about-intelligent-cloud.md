# Intelligent insights and cloud migration (on-premises only)

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you have full access to scenarios that are based on the intelligent cloud. For example, key performance indicators (KPIs) that are based on machine learning, or when you view your data in Power BI.  

However, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you don't have access to the same insights. If you want to benefit from online scenarios, you must migrate to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. For more information, see [Migrating On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Viewing Insights in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

For an on-premises environment for which data was migrated to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page in the online environment shows four key points of interest for most businesses:

- Cash availability
- Sales profitability
- Net income
- Inventory value

Next to the KPI charts, you get insights into potential areas of concern, including overdue payments. Choose each insight to explore the data.

The page also connects to Power BI for even more insights. Optionally, connect to Azure AI for even more intelligent insights. For more information, see [The Sales and Inventory Forecast Extension](ui-extensions-sales-forecast.md).
