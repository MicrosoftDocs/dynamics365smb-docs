# Setting Up [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] includes standard configurations for most business processes, but you can change the configuration to suit the needs of your organization.

For example, your chart of accounts is prefilled with a number of posting accounts ready for use. You can, of course, change the chart of accounts to suit your needs. For more information, see [Finance](finance.md).

From the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) menu, you can access assisted setup guides that help you configure certain scenarios and add features to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. For information about how to access all assisted and manual setup pages, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

Some functionality, either general or for specific business processes, can be set up manually in addition to the assisted setup guide. The following lists some of functionality that can you can set up manually.
