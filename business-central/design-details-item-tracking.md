# Design details: item tracking

As the flow of goods in today's supply chain becomes more and more complex, the ability to keep track of items is increasingly important to the companies involved. Monitoring an item's transaction flow is a legal requirement in the business of medical and chemical supply, but other businesses may want to monitor products with warranties or expiration dates for customer service reasons.  

An item tracking system should make it easy to handle serial and lot numbers, and consider where and when you receive items, where you store them, and when and where you sell them. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides application-wide functionality and a solid core on which to develop extensions.
