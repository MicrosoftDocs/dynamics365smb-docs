# Certifications

This content contains information about certifications in relation to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Country/region-specific certifications and accreditations

In some countries or regions, accounting software must be certified to comply with local tax regulation and financial requirements. Some countries exercise this as a yearly recurring requirement and others as a one-off requirement to comply with. Below is a list of the current countries/regions where Business Central has achieved certifications.

> [!NOTE]
> Only some countries/regions have this requirement.

- France (Tax Audit Certification) [(search by the product name at https://certificates.infocert.org/#)](https://certificates.infocert.org/#)  
- Germany (also covers Austria and Switzerland) [(link to certification in German)](https://www.bdo.de/de-de/themen/softwarebescheinungen/bdo/microsoft-dynamics-365-business-central)  

> [!NOTE]  
> In countries/regions where Microsoft does not release a local version, it is usually up to the partners to achieve certification of the Business Central base product, including the partner's localization and regulatory features on top.
