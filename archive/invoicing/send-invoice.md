# Send an invoice to a new customer in [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)]
> [!Note]

You create an invoice to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms. You can easily create a new invoice for a customer that you haven’t registered yet by tapping New Invoice from the Invoicing tab.  

## To create a new invoice
1. In [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], on the Home page, tap **New invoice**.
2. Enter the customer’s name, email address and invoice details. If this is a new customer, they are automatically added to [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] based on the information that you add. You'll add a few details the first time that you won't have to after this customer is registered.  
3. Under **Line Items**, add the product or service that you want to sell, choose the quantity, enter the unit price, and add sales tax if its applicable in your region. The invoice will update with the total cost.  
4. When you're ready to send the invoice, click Send, and your invoice is finalized and sent. The invoice is attached to the email that gets sent. You can also save the PDF file to your computer, print it, and email it to your customer. You can also add up to 5 other files to the email that gets sent, such as pictures or related documents.  

When your customer then pays the invoice, you must mark the invoice as paid in [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)].

## To mark an invoice as paid

1. Go to the **Invoices** list.  
2. Open the invoice you want to mark paid.  
3. Choose **Register payment**.  
4. Enter the amount you've received, and change the date if the payment was made earlier.  
5. Close the page.  

## Tax on invoices
Tax is calculated automatically based on the information that you specify. That means that you must make sure that you set up the right tax information in Settings, and that you have chosen the right tax rates for the customer or the items that you are selling. Depending on your country, the tax can be sales tax or value-added tax, for example.
