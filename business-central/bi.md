# Financial Business Intelligence

Businesses capture a tremendous amount of data during daily activities. This data, which reflects such things as the organization's sales figures, purchases, operational expenses, employee salaries, and budgets, represents valuable information, or business intelligence (BI), for decision makers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains many features to help you gather, analyze, and share your company data.

The **Dimensions** functionality plays an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. As such, you can use it to group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. Among other purposes, you use dimensions when defining analysis views and creating financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts and all entries in **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.
