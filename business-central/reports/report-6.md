# Trial Balance (report)

The **Trial Balance** report shows general ledger (G/L) accounts with a balance at date, and the net change over a period you specify.

You can filter the report by dimensions.

The report also includes subtotaling accounts, and you can configure it to show figures in the additional reporting currency (ACY).

## Use cases
