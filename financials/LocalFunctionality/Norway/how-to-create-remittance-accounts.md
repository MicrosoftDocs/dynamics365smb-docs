# How to: Create Remittance Accounts
You must create one remittance account for each bank account where payment is made. If an account is used to make payments to both domestic and foreign vendors, this account must be created two times—one time for domestic payments and one time for foreign payments.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The currency used for the bank account should be the same as the currency that the bank is using for this account. Exchange rates are based on the currency of the account and calculations are based on this currency.
