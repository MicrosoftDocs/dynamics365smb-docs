# Business Intelligence Quick Start

Being able to collect and analyze the ever-increasing amounts of data in an actionable way is an invaluable part of doing business these days. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers many business intelligence (BI) tools&mdash;both built-in and integrated with other services&mdash;to help your company in the decision-making process.

## Get insights on your key points of interest

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes built-in charts that can be displayed in the **Insights** part on your home page, covering *income & expense*, *cash flow*, *sales trends* and other reports. You can find additional key performance indicators (KPIs) on the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page, which displays actionable information from finance, inventory, sales, and procurement:

* Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intelligent Cloud Insights**, then choose the related link.

The available data cards and insights can be selected to open the related ledger page. The **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page also uses a connection with existing Power BI and Azure Machine Learning subscriptions to display analysis and forecast dashboards.

## Set up Power BI integration

You can connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power BI to create penetrating reports and powerful dashboards. Power BI integration provides many options to give insights based on your business' data, including a wide range of visual, filtering, and display customizations.

1. On your home page, choose the **Get started with Power BI** link.
2. Choose **Next**.
3. Choose the **Go to Power BI home page** action, sign in with your Power BI account, or start a trial using your work email address.
4. Back on the **Set Up Power BI Reports** page, choose **Next**.
5. On the next screen, choose **Next** to upload a demonstration report to Power BI, then choose **Finish**.

The report upload takes a few minutes, but you can resume working on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] during the transfer. After the upload, you can choose the **Select reports** action in the **Power BI Reports** part on your home page to display the available dashboards.

The Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a sample dashboard for the Cronus demonstration company. More ready-to-use dashboards and dataset connectors can be easily installed by browsing the **Apps** section in the Power BI website. There you'll see available apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that integrate and display data from finance, sales, and other areas. Learn more about the Power BI features in this [Business Central and Power BI](admin-powerbi.md) article, and see how to create your own dashboards at [Get started creating in the Power BI service](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-get-started).

You can also create visual reports based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using the **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** file type option on report request pages. Learn more at [Run and Print Reports](ui-work-report.md).
