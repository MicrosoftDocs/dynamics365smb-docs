# Creating Cost Budgets
Budgeting in cost accounting resembles budgeting in the general ledger. A cost budget is created based on cost types just as a budget for the general ledger is created based on general ledger accounts.  

A cost budget is created for a certain period of time, for example, a fiscal year. You can create as many cost budgets as needed. You can create a new cost budget manually, or by importing a cost budget, or by copying an existing cost budget as the budget base. For more information, see [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

You use the following pages to create and analyze cost budgets. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon to find a page, and then read the tooltip for each.
