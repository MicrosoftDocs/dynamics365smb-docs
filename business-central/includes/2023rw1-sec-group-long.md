> [!NOTE]
> Security groups are new to the online and on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] in 2023 release wave 1. They make it easier for administrators to manage user permissions by allowing them to group users by department, job function, and so on. Administrators assign the permissions to the group that its members need to do their jobs.
>
> Security groups are similar to the user groups that are currently available. However, user groups are only relevant for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. Security groups are based on groups in Microsoft 365 admin center or Azure portal. That benefits administrators because they can use their security groups with other Dynamics 365 apps. For example, if salespeople use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] and SharePoint, administrators don't have to recreate the group and its members.
