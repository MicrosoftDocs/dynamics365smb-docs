# View Archived Workflow Step Instances

All completed workflow step instances are saved on the **Archived Workflow Step Instances** page.  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> To view the history and status of workflows using Power Automate integration, choose the **My flows** action on the **Power Automate** page, then choose a flow to view its run history and status.
