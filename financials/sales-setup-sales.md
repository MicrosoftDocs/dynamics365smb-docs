# Setting Up Sales
Before you can manage sales processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's sales policies.

First, you must define the general setup, such as which sales documents are required and how their values are posted. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation.

A separate series of tasks related to creating customer master data is to record the customers' discount and price agreements in windows linked to the customer cards.

The periodic activity of creating customer cards for new customers is covered in the Sales section. For more information, see [How to: Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

Finance-related sales setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the Finance Setup section. For more information, see [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md).
