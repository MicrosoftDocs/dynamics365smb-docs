# VAT-VIES Declaration in Finland
ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_current_short](../../includes/nav_current_short_md.md)]--> provides Finnish enhancements to comply with regulations for VAT and European Union \(EU\) sales reporting. The **VAT-VIES Declaration Tax Auth** report and the **EC Sales List** report include the **EU Service** field, which allows you to print service-related sales amounts separately from item-related sales amounts based on different posting groups. This information is required in VAT reports for EU third-party trade transactions in 2010 and all subsequent years.
