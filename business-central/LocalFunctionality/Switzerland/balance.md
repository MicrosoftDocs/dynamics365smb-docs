# General ledger balance in the Swiss version

When you choose the **Balance** action on the **G/L Accounts** page, the **G/L Acc. Provisional Balance** page opens. It shows the balance of the final posted ledger entries and the balance of the postings entered in the current general journal.  

The journal balance references all lines from the beginning of the journal up to and including the current line.

For example, after recording customer payments you can check whether the bank balance is correct.

You can choose between two options:

* **All Journals**

    The unposted balance for all general ledger registers is calculated. It also includes values from ledgers that have another journal name not shown at the time.

* **Actual Journal**

    The unposted balance for the currently displayed general journal only is calculated.
