# Calculate Proportional VAT in the Norwegian Version
You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there is both deductible and non-deductible VAT. Because it is difficult to know where and how an item is used, you will have to contact the Norwegian tax authorities to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible based on historical data.  

### To calculate proportional VAT  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Calc. Prop. Deduction VAT**|Select to indicate that you want to use the proportional VAT percentage. **Important:**  This field is available on the **VAT Posting Setup** page, but it is not shown by default. [!INCLUDE[bp_customize](../../includes/bp_customize_md.md)]|  
    |**Proportional Deduction VAT %**|Enter the percentage of VAT to deduct.|  

3.  Choose the **OK** button.
