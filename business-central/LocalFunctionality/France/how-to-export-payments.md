The Payment Management module allows you to export your payments electronically via a text file or XMLport.

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Slip Setup**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  On the **Payment Class** page, select a payment class, and then choose the **Steps** action.  
3.  On the **Payment Step** page, fill in the **Name** field.  
4.  Choose the **Edit** action to open.  
5.  On the **Payment Step Card** page, fill in the fields.  
6.  In the **Action Type** field, select the **File** option, and then in the **Export Type** field, select the **Report** or the **XMLport** action.  
7.  In the **Export No.** field, specify the object that will export the payments.  

The next time you make a payment that is based on this payment step, the payments will be exported to a file as specified.
