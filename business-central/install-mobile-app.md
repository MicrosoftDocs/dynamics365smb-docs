# Getting Business Central on your mobile device

Access your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data from your mobile device. You can navigate through your business data, use features such as send to Excel or Microsoft 365, view up-to-date charts and KPIs, email sales quotes and invoices, and shoot and attach pictures with your camera. Follow the steps below to download the app and get started.

> [!TIP]
> Do want an app on your Windows or macOS computer desktop? See [Get the Business Central Desktop App](install-desktop-app.md).

## Get the app on my mobile device

1. Install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app on your mobile device by downloading the app from the App Store or Google Play.  
   - [App Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734847)
   - [Google Play](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734849)
2. Launch the app from your mobile device.
3. Enter your user name and password that you created during sign-up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and follow the instructions on the screen.

    If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has more than one production environment, then you'll be asked to choose the environment that you want to access (requires Business Central 2020 release wave 2 and later).

You should now have access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and can view and edit data.  

> [!TIP]
> If you want to connect the app to a sandbox environment, choose the **Advanced options** button, and then choose the **Cloud sandbox** sign-in option. Then, if you have more than one sandbox environment, choose the relevant environment.

## Use Business Central on-premises?

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you can also enjoy the benefits of the mobile app. The installation is similar, but with a couple of exceptions.

1. Install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app on your mobile device by downloading the app from the App Store or Google Play.  

   - [App Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734847)
   - [Google Play](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734849)
2. Launch the app from your mobile device.
3. Instead of entering an email address on the **Welcome** page, choose the **Advanced options** button, and then choose the **On-premises** sign-in option.
4. On the next page, in the **Service name** box, enter the web address that you use to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as *https://mybusinesscentral:443/BC170*. If you're not sure, ask your administrator.
5. Next, enter your user name and password for accessing Business Central.

   When completed, the Business Central App opens.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're having problems getting the app to work properly, talk to your administrator. It could be a missing prerequisite or an incomplete configuration.
