# Liabilities (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Liabilities** report provides an overview of your company's financial obligations, highlighting total liabilities, current liabilities, payroll liabilities, and long-term liabilities. It also shows key performance indicators such as debt ratio and dept-to-equity ratio, along with total assets.

These key performance indicators can help you understand the balance between debt and equity while monitoring liabilities that affect future cash flow and operational flexibility.

Drill through into the **Liabilities Drill-Through** page to explore the underlying ledger entries that make up the balance.

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives can use the report to evaluate your company's financial position before engaging in a new expansive initiative. By first analyzing current liabilities, you can gauge your immediate debt burden. This analysis helps you determine whether there are enough liquid assets to meet short term obligations, and ensure you have cash-flow to support existing operations and new development.

Next, you could assess the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios. These key performance indicators provide insight into the company's leverage and risk profile. For example, a high debt-to-equity ratio could indicate that the company has a high reliance on borrowed funds. This type of data can help inform how you decide to finance the expansion project.
